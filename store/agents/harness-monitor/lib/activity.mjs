/**
 * When did this harness last actually do something?
 *
 * The obvious answers are all wrong, and each one is wrong in a way that would stop the fleet's living
 * agents or keep its dead ones running:
 *
 *   the registry's `updatedAt`  the daemon reconciles every five seconds, so every row reads "now"
 *   the transcript's mtime      a running engine appends bookkeeping — task notifications, away
 *                               summaries, queue operations — to conversations nobody has touched in
 *                               days; on this machine that made 34 of 85 harnesses look an hour old
 *   the pane's tmux activity    a spinner redraw is activity, and an engine that exited hours ago
 *                               leaves its last frame on screen forever
 *
 * What a person means by "nobody has touched this since Tuesday" is the last TURN: a message from them
 * or from the agent. That is in the transcript, and it is at the end of it, so the tail is enough — a
 * bounded read from the back of the file, newest line first, stopping at the first real turn.
 *
 * Every engine that writes JSONL is handled by naming the line types that are turns; the others fall
 * back to the hook timestamps the daemon records, which is exactly what this module tells its caller by
 * returning null rather than guessing.
