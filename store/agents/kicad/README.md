# KiCad, as a Harness agent

[Harness](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/openharness) agent package for the **KiCad-native**
pipeline of [Autonomous Circuit](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-circuit): describe a board
in the chat pane and get a real KiCad project — a wired schematic, copper KiCad's own ERC/DRC has
checked, a prototype packet a fab can quote — with the project's own live board view in the pane beside
the agent. Runs on Codex (GPT-6 Astra) with the upstream tile's exact arguments: approvals off, sandbox
off (kicad-cli, pcbnew and Freerouting do not survive it), and Circuit's Stop hook that finishes a build
and asks once for the firmware. What the person flashes, they flash from the pane's Flash button.

The KiCad tile is the sibling of [Autonomous Circuit](../autonomous-circuit/) (the v1 pipeline, tscircuit
sources, the same repository's `main`), not its replacement: the two wrap different branches of one
repository, and a user who wants a KiCad project picks KiCad.

This folder is a **wrapper**. It holds no Circuit code: `toolchain/setup.sh` fetches the project from
its own public repository at the commit `VERSIONS` pins (everything but its product library and
examples) into `upstream/`, then runs the KiCad package's own setup there
(`upstream/harness/kicad/`). The manifest points the agent at that package's `AGENTS.md`, skill and
template; the doctor, workspace init and viewer are that package's own scripts, run against the copy.

- `harness.json` — name, category, engine, and paths into `upstream/harness/kicad/`.
- `VERSIONS` — the repository, the pinned commit (on its `feat/v2-kicad-native` branch), the sparse patterns.
- `toolchain/runtimes.sh` — the store's copy: a Node and a venv Python of the package's own.
- `toolchain/kicad.sh` — KiCad vendored at the pin (macOS: the official DMG, copied without 3D models
  and help); `VERSIONS` carries its version, URL, checksum and size.
- `toolchain/fetch-upstream.sh` — the read-only, sparse, blob-less fetch (a tarball when there is no
  git); `setup.sh`, `doctor.sh`, `init-workspace.sh`, `viewer.sh`, `python` hand off to the package's
  scripts of the same names.

What the machine must have: **the engine's CLI, signed in.** Everything else comes with the package,
installed into its own folder and never onto the machine: a Node and a venv Python (`runtimes.sh`),
**KiCad itself** (`toolchain/kicad.sh` — on macOS the official unified DMG at the version and checksum
`VERSIONS` pins, mounted and copied into `kicad/KiCad.app` without the 3D models and the offline help:
a 1.4 GB download, 1.3 GB on disk; the manifest points the pipeline at it with `KICADPY_CLI`,
`KICADPY_PYTHON`, `CIRCUIT_KICAD_CLI` and `KICAD_HARNESS_SHARE`), Freerouting with its JRE, and the built
viewer. git is optional: without it the pinned commit arrives as GitHub's tarball. On Linux there is
no relocatable KiCad artifact, so KiCad stays a system install (apt/dnf/flatpak) named by
`KICADPY_CLI` / `KICADPY_PYTHON`, and the doctor says so.

## Credit and stewardship

Autonomous Circuit is its own project, [autonomous-ai/autonomous-circuit](https://github.com/autonomous-ai/autonomous-circuit),
under its repository's licence (MIT). Nothing of it is changed or copied here. Bugs in board generation
belong in that repository, bugs in the wrapper belong here, and a newer KiCad tile is a bump of
`UPSTREAM_COMMIT` in `VERSIONS`.

```sh
harness dsh check "$PWD"                           # conformance (warns: the project arrives with setup)
harness dsh install "$PWD" --link                  # this checkout as the installed agent
python3 -m unittest discover -s toolchain          # the wrapper's own tests
```
