/**
 * Backend hub — remote-machine adapter endpoint (`/api/adapter-ws`).
 *
 * A "remote" machine has no manager/agent-node: the user's own COMPUTER runs the machine-adapter CLI,
 * which dials in here and occupies the NODE side of the machineId — the same role a manager socket
 * plays for a docker node:
 *   - down:{machineId} (client chat/RPC)  → forwarded to the adapter socket
 *   - adapter `up` frames (normalized claude events + `<x>_result` RPC replies) → publishUp(machineId)
 *   - presence key machine:{machineId}:mgr = 'remote' while connected → drives web node_status
 *
 * Auth: the first WebSocket subprotocol is the user's SSO access token. The stable `computer` query
 * parameter selects (or creates) that user's Remote machine; a managed machine never gains a second
 * writer for its down:{machineId} channel.
