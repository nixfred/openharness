 * them by name. The adapter refuses them too unless they arrive on the backend's own `connId: ''`.
 *
 * Senders, all backend-side: `lib/adapterWs.ts` (on connect), `services/MachineService.ts`
 * (rename, revoke) and `lib/adapterAccountPushes.ts` (desk_changed, zoo_changed, machines_changed —
 * forged, each one makes every window on that computer re-read from this backend, device_keys_changed),
 * and `lib/adapterWs.ts` again for `devlog_append_result`, the answer to a machine's own log append.
