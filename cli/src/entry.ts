/**
 * The bundle's entry (build-bundle.mjs): which process this is decides what it loads.
 *
 * Every daemon process runs the one `cli.js` the updater downloads and swaps, and every one used to
 * evaluate all of it at start: harnessd's master, each service in its own process and the CLI alike.
 * Measured from the bundle at idle on 2026-10-05, the master took 160 MiB resident and each service 115
 * to 160, so isolating the services cost more memory than everything else the daemon does. Here the
 * master and the services load only their own modules: esbuild, bundling without code splitting, turns
 * each dynamic import below into a module initialised the first time it is imported, so the code a
 * process never imports is parsed but never run. The core (`__run`) starts as it does from the lean bundle
 * (coreProcess.ts), and everything else is the CLI as it always was.
 *
 * Nothing heavy may be imported statically here: it would be evaluated by every process.
