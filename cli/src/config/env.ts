//     ran it has been LIVING there since — that tree holds their current token, tmux registry and
//     E2EE pairings, while `~/.harness` is frozen at whatever it was when they upgraded. So the data
//     dir is FORCE-MOVED across: `~/.machine` wins outright. Anything else would silently roll those
//     users back to a stale token and an empty session registry.
//  2. Files INSIDE the data dir were renamed (machine-id → computer-id, harness-name → machine-name,
//     machine.log → harness.log — the log carries the PRODUCT's name, like the tree it sits in, so this
//     one went out and came back). Within one tree there is nothing to arbitrate, so those only fire
//     when the new name is still free — and they run first, so the force-move above still wins.
//

// into the same file under its new name.
