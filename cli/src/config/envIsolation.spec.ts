/**
 * The suite must never read or write the developer's real `~/.harness`.
 *
 * `vitest.setup.ts` moved the DATA dir to a throwaway after a spec wrote a fixture into the live
 * registry. The RUNTIME dir is the same hazard in the other direction: a real `current-grid` or
 * `current-node` pointer there outranks the fakes a spec puts on PATH (`gridExec.ts` resolves the
 * managed runtime BEFORE PATH, by design), so the suite would measure this machine's managed
 * binaries instead of the code under test.
