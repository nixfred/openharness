/**
 * The devices in a process of their own (`harness __service devices`, harnessd/services.ts): the dials on
 * this computer's USB ports, the window bridges they speak through, the fleet's router and its lane to the
 * owner's other machines, the voice router and the Devices tab (services/devices.ts), on a link to the core
 * (docs/design/2026-10-06-core-boundary-next.md, step 9, D2).
 *
 * A device is hardware speaking whatever its firmware says, a lane to the backend and a voice router's
 * engine worker: here a device that hangs the event loop, leaks or crashes costs the devices, and the
 * master starts them again, while every agent and window goes on. The serial ports are this process's,
 * one owner each (`O_EXLOCK`, cable/serial.ts).
 *
 * It runs on a core API of its own, over its link (core/devicesLink.ts): what the dial reads in line while
 * it builds a frame (this computer's agents, their names and models, this computer, the sign-in, whether a
 * window is there) is the core's answer to `view`, asked again as the dial's tick or ⌘K builds a list;
 * everything else is asked of the core when it is needed, or told to it. The core keeps what the windows
 * said and tells it again each time this process connects.
