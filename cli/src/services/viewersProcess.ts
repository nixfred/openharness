/**
 * The DSH viewers in their own process (`harness __service viewers`, with `HARNESSD_SERVICES=viewers`).
 *
 * The same viewer servers and verdict watches as in the core's process (services/viewers.ts), on a core
 * API built here. The agents are the ones the core attaches: it says each attach and detach
 * (`service_event`), and each time this process connects it asks the core for every agent with a harness
 * (`service_query agents`) and catches up, so a process started after a crash, or reconnected after the
 * core restarted, holds exactly the viewers the core's agents should have.
 *
 * What the core used to read from the service while it builds a frame (an agent's DSH context, where the
 * windows' viewer pane forwards) is told to the core whenever it changes (`service_query context`), and
 * the core keeps it (core/viewersLink.ts). Where the service would push a frame or move the windows'
 * viewer panes in the core's process, it tells the core here, and the core does both as before.
 *
 * The viewer servers, the watches on every harness's workspace and their restarts are this process's
 * alone: a crash or a leak costs the viewers, and the master starts them again. A new process stops the
 * viewer servers a crashed one left running before it starts its own (dsh/viewerLedger.ts). A core restart
 * no longer restarts every viewer: they stay up here, and the new core hears their URLs at once.
 *
 * A client served a viewer over its connection (services/viewers.ts `serveViewers`) reaches this process
 * through the core: each frame of its stream is told here (`service_event` `stream`), and what the stream
 * answers goes back to that connection through the core (`service_notice` `viewer`). A rendered frame
 * (`viewer_surface`) is the core's question (`surface`), which only the core asks. The connections are the
 * core's: when it goes, every stream it carried goes with it.
