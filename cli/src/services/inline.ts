/**
 * The services that run in a process of their own by default (harnessd/services.ts `SERVICE_HOSTS`), for
 * when they run in the core's instead: with `HARNESSD_SERVICES=none` (debugging, or a quick way back), a
 * subset named, a master too old to run them, or no master at all (`harness start -f`).
 *
 * The gateway (gateway/start.ts) is here too: the relay and its keys, run in the core's process the same way.
 *
 * The core imports this module only then, and only dynamically (core/main.ts): what it reaches is the
 * services' own code, which the core's process then never loads by default. That is how a service in its
 * own process leaves the core's import closure, which src/architecture.spec.ts checks for forbidden
 * dependencies without following this one import (docs/design/2026-10-06-core-boundary-next.md, "The
 * target, and its test"). The core still routes these services' requests and holds their fallbacks: both are
 * declared in core/api.ts, which it loads either way.
