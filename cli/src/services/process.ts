 * one heartbeat, and so one memory budget, for everything it runs. It exits when the master goes, so a
 * crash never leaves one behind, and stops what it runs first. Each service in it (`runServiceProcess`)
 * reaches the core on a link of its own, the way a window does (the core's local socket), under the
 * service role, its own name and the token the master gave the core and this process
 * (core/serviceLinks.ts). It reconnects with backoff whenever the core restarts, and the service keeps
 * its own state meanwhile. It answers the requests the core routes to it, hears what the core tells it,
 * and asks the core what it needs to know.
