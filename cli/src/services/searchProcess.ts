/**
 * Session search in its own process (`harness __service search`, with `HARNESSD_SERVICES=search`).
 *
 * The same index as in the core's process (services/search.ts, lib/sessionSearch/), on a core API built
 * here: the agents come from the core (`service_query agents`, refreshed on every turn boundary it is
 * told of), and everything else — the database readers, the conversations Harness did not start — is
 * read here, as the core would read it. Its SQLite index, its memory and its native code are this
 * process's alone: a crash or a leak in search costs search, and the master starts it again.
