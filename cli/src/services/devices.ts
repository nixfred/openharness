/**
 * The devices: the dials on this computer's USB ports, the window bridges they speak through, the fleet's
 * router every turn goes through (⌘K's too), the voice router, and the Devices tab
 * (docs/design/2026-10-06-core-boundary-next.md, "Devices — its own process", step 9).
 *
 * They reach the core only through `CoreApi` and the core reaches them only through `ports.devices`
 * (core/api.ts `DevicesPort`), so that they can run in a process of their own: the serial ports are
 * hardware, a dial speaks whatever its firmware says, and one device failing must cost the devices, never
 * a session. Inside, each part answers for itself (services/devicesGuard.ts): a dial throwing on every
 * frame costs ⌘K nothing, and a fleet that cannot start costs the dial nothing.
 *
 * Where the core used to wire all this inside `runForeground` (before step 9) it now hands over what the
 * windows on this computer say, as it hears it, and every card it sends the devices; the window's desk,
 * tabs, unread rows and focus it keeps, and says again whenever the devices start.
 *
 * The Wi-Fi device is a service of its own beside these (services/wifi.ts), in the same process, on a link
 * of its own: it rides the gateway's sessions, and borrows the dial's walk and stroke through the core.
