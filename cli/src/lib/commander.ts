 * CommanderMirror — shares completed-turn decisions between desktop and device,

 *   tool_start              → {kind:'tool', text, recap, color, detail}
 *   tool_start TodoWrite    → + {kind:'processing', todos:[{c,s}]}   (checklist)
 *   tool_start Task/Agent   → + {kind:'agents', agents:[{text,color}]} (live sub-agent list)
 *   subagent_finished       → + {kind:'agents', …} with that row ticked off
 *   turn_ended (device on)  → {kind:'processing', text:'Summarizing…'} then, once the LLM one-shot
 *                             returns, {kind:'summary', text:body, recap} (persisted per session,
 *                             and handed to the NEXT turn's summariser as its previous recap)
 *   turn_ended (no device)  → local recap + desktop notification when notifyWithoutDevice is on
 *   turn_ended (empty text) → {kind:'done'}                          (clear busy)
 *
 * Every frame carries top-level `agentId` + `dbSessionId` (= the tmux session id). The recap
 * (`summarizeTurnText`) is injected so it's unit-testable with a stub. Mirrors the hosted runtime's
 * device-gated recap (recap.ts / manager.ts triggerTurnRecap / websocket.ts handleBrainSummaryEvent).
