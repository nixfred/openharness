/**
 * A transcript's history a page at a time — what a client scrolling a thread asks for (`session_get`)
 * and how long the thread is (`sessions_list`) — without reading the whole file. Attach's rule
 * (lib/attachTranscript.ts) holds here too: the work a request costs grows with the page, never with the
 * history. Both requests used to read every line into memory first, so a phone opening the thread of a
 * long Codex session asked the daemon for as much memory as the crash of 2026-10-03 took.
 *
 * Lines are `tailFile(path, Infinity)`'s, the reader every page came from: LF, CR and CRLF end a line,
 * a line that is only whitespace is no line, and a last line with no ending yet is one. Pages are the
 * windows `windowRawLines` and `windowCodexLines` cut from those lines, with the same cursors, except:
 *  - a page holds at most `PAGE_MAX_BYTES` (see `pageBefore`), and a line longer than that is counted
 *    but left out — the old window held whatever its turn did, a whole file at worst;
 *  - a Claude cursor names the newest line with that id, where the old window took the oldest. Ids are
 *    unique in practice, and finding the oldest would mean reading back to the start every time.
