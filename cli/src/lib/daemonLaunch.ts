/**
 * The parts of starting a daemon that decide whether it WORKED — pulled out of cli.ts so they can be
 * tested without a backend, a bundle, or a real child.
 *
 * Two phases, and the split is the point. A spawned child first has to BIND its control endpoints;
 * only then does it try the backend. The old single wait watched the log for "[backend] connected"
 * and, when that never came inside ten seconds, gave up with "unreachable" — leaving a child that was
 * still booting (a slow login shell, tmux adoption) with no pid file and nothing guarding it, which is
 * exactly when a second `harness start` would spawn a competitor for the port.
 *
 * The bind signal is the pid file itself: the daemon writes its own pid there ONLY after the port is
 * bound (see runForeground), so `readPid() === child.pid` is something only a bound child can
 * produce. No parsing, no shared-log ambiguity.
