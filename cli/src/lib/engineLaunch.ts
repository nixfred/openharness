/**
 * A stopped engine is continued, never taken for one that exited: Ctrl+Z, which Claude Code and Codex
 * both answer by suspending themselves (they give the terminal back and stop their whole process
 * group, "Run `fg` to bring Claude Code back"), or a SIGSTOP from outside. tmux does this for a pane's
 * own process (server_child_stopped continues it at once), but the engine is the pane shell's child,
 * and an agent's pane has no prompt to type `fg` into.
 *
 * The pane shell has job control: the engine runs as its foreground job, in a process group of its own
 * that holds the terminal. Seeing that job stop, the shell used to carry on to the end of the launch
 * script (bash, sh) or give the script up at once (zsh), and exit, hanging up the stopped engine: the
 * pane closed and the agent was gone. Now `harness_resume` puts a stopped engine back in the
 * foreground with `fg`, as often as it stops, until it really exits, and keeps that exit status.
 * Measured in tmux with zsh 5.9, bash 3.2 and 5.3, sh and dash, each its own way:
 *
 *  - zsh gives up the whole script when a foreground job stops inside a function, an `if`, a loop or
 *    an `eval`, and carries on only after one at the top level; a stop seen by `fg` is fine anywhere.
 *    So the engine, and an install, run at the script's top level (`engineRunScript`). zsh prints its
 *    "suspended" and "continued" lines as they happen, as it would in a terminal.
 *  - bash breaks out of every loop around a job that stops, wherever the loop is, so there (and in
 *    sh and dash) the resume calls itself instead of looping; zsh's loops, which keeps it clear of
 *    zsh's limit on nested calls.
 *  - `fg` keeps its standard error. Run without a terminal of its own, bash takes standard error for
 *    the terminal, so a `fg 2>/dev/null` there never handed the terminal over: the engine stopped
 *    again on its first write to it, at once and for ever, until the recursion overflowed (bash 5.3
 *    as Fedora's /bin/sh, the hand-off of a fish or tcsh login).
 *  - A stop that comes back within a second of its resume, three times running, is resumed only after
 *    a second's pause, so nothing can spin; one that cannot take the terminal (TTIN, TTOU) five times
 *    running, or the thousandth stop of one run where the resume recurses, ends the engine instead
 *    (SIGKILL, status 137), and the pane turns into a shell as after any exit.
 *  - bash puts the terminal back in its own modes when a job stops and does not restore the job's on
 *    `fg` (zsh does; dash leaves them alone). Neither Claude Code nor Codex takes raw mode again on a
 *    plain SIGCONT, only after a stop of its own, so one stopped from outside under bash comes back
 *    to a line-mode terminal until it sets its modes again: accepted, and the e2e shows it. Ctrl+Z is
 *    not affected: the engine gave the terminal back and takes it again itself.
 *  - A stop of a process below the engine's own is seen by no shell, as one below a pane's process
 *    is seen by no tmux: npm's Codex is a Node wrapper with the native engine as its child, and a
 *    SIGSTOP of that child alone leaves it stopped. Its Ctrl+Z stops the whole group, wrapper too.
 *  - ksh93 stops the whole `... || harness_status=$?` list with the job and goes on with a status of
 *    0, so there a stop still reads as the engine's exit, as it did everywhere before.
 *
 * Only a job that stopped is resumed, told by its status — 128 plus STOP, TSTP, TTIN or TTOU, by name,
 * since the numbers differ between macOS and Linux — and not by `%%` alone, which could be a job a rc
 * file left running.
 *
 * Every other command the script waits on — a probe, a backoff, the wait for a take-over — runs in a
 * command substitution. That keeps it in the pane shell's own process group, which has no parent in
 * its session (tmux is outside it), and the kernel discards a terminal stop sent to such a group: a
 * Ctrl+Z at that moment is ignored rather than stopping a helper in a function, which zsh would again
 * take for the end of the script.
