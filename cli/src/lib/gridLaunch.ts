/**
 * Pointing an agent at an Autonomous Grid instead of the engine's own login.
 *
 * The desktop app lets a user pick a grid (and optionally a model), mints a short-lived relay key for
 * it, and sends the result as `payload.grid` on `agent_create` / `agent_retarget`. Nothing about that
 * reaches an engine by itself: this CLI is what spawns the engine, so this module turns that payload
 * into the launch — environment, and where the vendor demands it, argv.
 *
 * The one place that payload is kept is the registry row (`RegisteredSession.gridLaunch`, in a 0600
 * file this daemon owns) — so a restart, or a pane recreated after a reboot, relaunches onto the SAME
 * grid with the SAME key rather than silently coming back on the engine's own login. Nothing THIS
 * module writes (argv, a config directory) ever carries the key; that rule is unchanged.
 *
 * ## Every entry here is the vendor's own documented contract
 *
 * The relay speaks two dialects — Anthropic Messages at `<grid>/relay`, and OpenAI
 * chat/completions + responses at `<grid>/relay/v1` — so an engine can be pointed at it only if the
 * engine itself offers a way to change its endpoint. Those ways differ, and none of them is
 * guessable: `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` for Claude Code, `-c model_providers.*` argv for Codex,
 * `GROK_MODELS_BASE_URL` for Grok, `COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL` for Copilot. Each entry below cites
 * where it was read from.
 *
 * An engine with no entry is REFUSED, and the refusal names why for that engine specifically. Three
 * shapes of "no" appear, and they are worth telling apart because only one of them could ever change
 * on our side:
 *
 *   * **Wrong protocol.** The engine CAN be re-pointed, but at its own vendor's API rather than an
 *     OpenAI- or Anthropic-shaped one. Cursor Agent reads `CURSOR_API_ENDPOINT` (default
 *     `https://api2.cursor.sh`, read out of the shipped bundle) and Antigravity reads
 *     `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` — handing either the relay would send it a dialect the relay does not
 *     serve (grid ADR 0012 lists Gemini as a future data edit, not a served endpoint). A knob
 *     existing is not the same as a knob that helps, and pointing one of these at a grid would fail
 *     inside the app with an error naming neither.
 *   * **Config-file only** (pi, kilo): the provider block has to be written into the user's own
 *     dotfile. Editing another tool's configuration on someone's behalf is a side effect that
 *     outlives the agent, so this module does not do it.
 *   * **Nothing documented** (muse, commandcode, amp, devin): no vendor documentation describes an
 *     endpoint override. These are the entries that could gain a contract tomorrow — with a cited
 *     source, not a plausible-looking variable name.
 *
 * Refusing is the point. Silently launching against the engine's own login would put the agent
 * somewhere other than where the user said, spend the wrong account, and look like it worked.

 * Four things here are load-bearing, each of which breaks the engine differently when got wrong:
 *
 *  1. **No top-level `model` key on v1.** OpenCode 1.x's schema `$ref`s a CLOSED enum of known public
 *     models with no wildcard branch, so naming a private grid's model there makes OpenCode refuse
 *     the whole config at startup — a failure that arrives as a dead pane, long after the launch
 *     looked fine. The model is selected on argv instead, which is not schema-validated. v2 is the
 *     other way round: its TUI has no `-m`, and it accepts `model` naming the provider declared here
 *     (measured on 2.0.18: a fresh `--standalone` pane opened on it), so on v2 the key is written.
 *  2. **`baseURL` is the relay root verbatim.** It already ends in `/relay/v1`; the SDK appends
 *     `/chat/completions` itself, so any "normalising" here 404s every request.
 *  3. **`apiKey` is `{env:…}`, not the key.** Nothing written to disk by this module may contain a
 *     credential. This diverges from the advice a person following OpenCode's own docs gets — there
 *     the literal is recommended, because an unset variable silently becomes an empty string and a
 *     human-launched OpenCode has no guarantee the variable is set. Here it IS guaranteed: the
 *     daemon puts it in the pane's environment with `tmux new-session -e` before the engine starts.
 *  4. **`limit` only when the window is known, and then BOTH halves.** OpenCode requires `context`
 *     and `output` together and rejects the config given only one. It is how OpenCode knows how much
 *     room is left, so without it a session ran on until the relay refused a request as too long,
 *     never having compacted. Absent when the relay did not report a window: inventing one would be
 *     worse than OpenCode's own defaults. `output` is a quarter of the window, capped at OpenCode's
 *     own 32K output ceiling — it is also what OpenCode holds back from the window for the reply, so

  // opencode's simplest documented custom provider: the OpenAI-compatible pair

  // `provider/model` pair whose provider id is not documented for the env-var route, and inventing
  // one would send it looking for a model that does not exist.
  // OpenCode is the one engine here that an endpoint variable alone cannot steer, and the reason is
  // worth stating because `OPENAI_BASE_URL` looks like it should be enough — the grid CLI's own
  // `grid info --env` exports exactly that pair, and it is enough for hermes.
  //
  // OpenCode's `openai` provider carries a COMPILED-IN model catalogue (49 entries: gpt-4o,
  // gpt-5.6-terra-pro, …). It sends requests to `OPENAI_BASE_URL` but never asks that endpoint what
  // it serves, so pointing it at a grid gives an engine that will only ever name models the grid has
  // never heard of. Measured: it selected `gpt-5.6-terra-pro` and the relay answered
  //
  //   503 · No providers available for this model. This grid serves: DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731, …
  //
  // and `-m openai/DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731` — naming a real grid model under its built-in provider —
  // made OpenCode's own server throw instead.
  //
  // So it takes the shape codex and pi take: DECLARE a provider. `OPENCODE_CONFIG` names a config
  // file, this daemon writes one into a directory it owns, and the grid arrives as a provider whose
  // models are the grid's own ids. The user's `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` is never opened.
  //
  // ## v2 (2.0.18, measured)
  //
  // The TUI rejects `-m` and exits 1, so the model goes in the config file instead (see
  // `opencodeGridConfig`, point 1). And by default the TUI attaches to ONE background service shared
  // by every OpenCode on the machine, which never sees a pane's `OPENCODE_CONFIG`: a session put on a
  // provider declared only here showed the service's default model in its footer. `--standalone`
  // gives the pane its own server, which reads the file — the same session then showed the declared

  // config.yaml and no env tier at all (`cli.py:_init_model_and_provider`, "Priority: CLI args >
  // env vars > config file" — the env half is about the provider). And a grid move relaunches as
  // `hermes --resume <id>`, which restores the model stored on the session row unless argv carried
  // an explicit `-m`; that flag is the documented opt-out ("resume must not clobber an explicit -m
  // with the session's stored model", `cli.py` / `cli_model_switch_mixin.py`).
  //
  // Measured on 2026-09-08 before this line existed: the pane's environment said
  // `HERMES_INFERENCE_MODEL=GLM-4.7-Flash` — which is what the desktop's model pill read back and
  // printed — while hermes itself ran DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731, the default in the user's own
  // ~/.hermes/config.yaml and the model persisted on the resumed session's row.
  //
  // The variable stays beside the flag: `-z`/`--tui` read it, and it is how `gridAssignment.ts`
  // answers "which model is this agent on" for hermes without parsing a live process's argv.
  //
  // ⚠️ The ENDPOINT has no such flag. Hermes's custom-provider resolver deliberately ignores
  // `OPENAI_BASE_URL` ("config.yaml is the single source of truth for endpoint URLs",
  // `runtime_provider_backends.py`) and the CLI exposes no `--base-url`, so moving a hermes agent
  // between grids moves its model but leaves its requests on whatever relay config.yaml names. The
  // only lever left is `HERMES_HOME`, which would take state.db and the user's skills with it and
  // break the resume this move depends on.
  //
  // ⚠️ The overlay is the ONE thing here a machine can refuse. `HERMES_MANAGED_DIR` REPLACES
  // `/etc/hermes` rather than adding to it — so on a machine where an administrator pinned Hermes
  // settings there, writing ours would take their policy away for as long as the agent runs. The
  // agent still launches on the grid; it launches without web tools, which is the smaller loss and
  // the one the app can say out loud (`unsupported`). The machine fact arrives from the caller
