/**
 * Reading a grid the way a person glances at it — without knocking.
 *
 * A grid sleeps when nobody uses it, and on the platform a SIGNED-IN read of a sleeping grid wakes it
 * (grid-apis `wake_routes`: presence of a credential, never its validity). This daemon used to read
 * every grid an account is in about once a minute, with the account's credential, so none of them ever
 * slept — and the read that woke one usually came back empty, because a just-woken master has not heard
 * from its providers yet. Everything here reads with NO credential:
 *
 * - The master's overview and its provider discovery are public (grid-src serves both unauthenticated),
 *   so an AWAKE grid answers exactly as it would a signed-in read;
 * - a SLEEPING grid answers at once `503 {code: "grid_asleep"}` and is not started, and that answer may
 *   carry `last_known` — what the grid was serving when the platform put it to sleep.
 *
 * ⚠️ **Never add a credential to anything in this file.** Not an Authorization header, not x-api-key,
 * not a token in the query. The whole resource saving rests on it, and its failure is SILENT: every list
 * still looks perfect while every open harness keeps every grid awake again. A person's act that SHOULD
 * wake a grid (a message, Start, an explicit wake, a prewarm) goes out another way — `gridWake.ts` — on
 * purpose.
 *
 * The values below are cross-repo (the lockstep register; `tests/test_grid_reads_lockstep.py` in the
 * public `grid` repository finds the two literals by these exact quoted spellings).
