/**
 * What the grids this computer is signed into can answer — read WITHOUT waking any of them.
 *
 * Every picker, the Models panel and the macOS Models menu ask here, and until issue 02 of
 * grid-reads-without-waking each ask was a `grid models` spawn plus a SIGNED-IN read of the relay's
 * model list. On the platform a signed-in read of a sleeping grid wakes it, so an open app kept every
 * grid of the account awake all day — and the read that woke one usually came back empty. Now:
 *
 * - each grid is read through `gridReader.ts`, with no credential: an awake grid answers as before, a
 *   sleeping one says so at once (with the platform's record of what it served) and is not started;
 * - what was read is kept as a PICTURE per grid (`gridPicture.ts`, persisted), so an answer is given at
 *   once and a sleeping grid shows its last known models instead of vanishing;
 * - the account's OWN grid, whose status the owner can read, is read at most once per asleep episode.
 *
 * The credentialed model-list read is gone from every automatic path. What still wakes a grid is a
 * person's act (issue 03): an explicit wake, moving an agent onto a sleeping grid, the first keystroke
 * into a pane whose agent runs on one — each decided here, from the picture, and sent through
 * `gridWake.ts`, the one module that reads a grid with its credential. Beside that, the picture says
 * which rows only a computer of the account's that seems offline serves (`gridPresence.ts`): a label,
 * never a removal.
