/**
 * Putting an agent back on its own login, ON THE MODEL IT WAS USING BEFORE.
 *
 * Moving an agent to a grid and back is not symmetric, and the asymmetry is invisible until you do
 * it. Going TO a grid sets the endpoint AND the model. Coming back clears both — and the engine then
 * restores whatever its OWN session file remembers, which is the grid's model. Measured on Claude
 * Code: after a switch back it said
 *
 *   Session model Qwen3.6-35B-A3B-UD-Q5_K_XL could not be restored (not a model this version of
 *   Claude Code recognizes) — using opus instead.
 *
 * The engine picked a house default, which is the one thing the harness must not let it do on the
 * user's behalf: the person had a model before, and coming back should return them to it rather
 * than to whatever the vendor considers reasonable. So the model in use is remembered when an agent
 * leaves for a grid, and re-selected when it comes back.
 *
 * ## Why this is its own table rather than a flag on the grid contract
 *
 * A grid launch answers "where do requests go, with which credential, for which model". This answers
 * only the last third, against the vendor's own endpoint. They share no fields, and the mechanisms
 * genuinely differ per engine — Claude Code reads an environment variable while Codex and Hermes
 * resolve the interactive CLI's model from argv.
 *
 * ## An engine with no entry gets nothing, deliberately
 *
 * The alternative to a cited mechanism is a guessed one, and a guessed model flag does not fail
 * loudly: the engine starts, ignores what it did not understand, and runs on a model the person did
 * not choose — which is the exact failure this module exists to remove. So an engine absent from
 * this table relaunches the way it always did, and the engine picks. That is today's behaviour, not
 * a regression, and it is recoverable by hand in the pane.
