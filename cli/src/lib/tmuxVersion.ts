/**
 * What this machine's tmux can do, for every feature newer than the oldest tmux Harness runs on.
 *
 * Harness runs on the tmux a distribution ships, and those are old: RHEL and Rocky 8 ship 2.7, Debian
 * 10 ships 2.8, Ubuntu 20.04 ships 3.0a, Debian 11 ships 3.1c. tmux checks a whole `;` command list
 * before it runs any of it, so one flag an older tmux does not know fails every command in the list:
 * the pane-owner tag (`set-option -p`, 3.0) chained into `new-session` made every agent create fail on
 * tmux 2.x (PR #789's review). And a flag it does not know in a one-off command is its usage text where
 * a result was expected — `new-session -e` once came back as `SPAWN_FAILED: usage: new-session ...`, a
 * dead end for anyone who did not already know the flag was new. So each feature is named here, with
 * the release that brought it, and every caller asks by name.
