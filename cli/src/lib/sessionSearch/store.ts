/**
 * The session search index: one SQLite database per machine, one row per turn, searched with FTS5.
 *
 * Keyword search (BM25) rather than embeddings, on purpose. What people type into a quick-open box is
 * one to three words and very often an exact token — a codename, a file, an issue number, a branch —
 * which BM25 matches exactly and an embedding blurs. It needs no model, answers in milliseconds, and
 * updates a turn at a time. See docs/research/2026-09-26-session-search.md.
 *
 * Every query word must appear in the SESSION, not necessarily in one turn: "mobile swipe" finds the
 * session titled Mobile whose swipe discussion came an hour later. A turn holding every word is still
 * the better match and ranks first.
