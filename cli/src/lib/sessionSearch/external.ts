/**
 * Conversations on this machine that Harness did not start: sessions people ran in a terminal, an
 * editor or an engine's app. Found where each engine keeps them, so Cmd-P and the welcome page can
 * find them and open one in Harness (`agent_create` with `resumeSessionId`), taking it over from a
 * terminal that still has it.
 *
 * Each engine is a provider (`externals/<engine>.ts`): how it lists its conversations, which process
 * has one open, and whether that process is mid-turn. This file joins them: one list, one look at
 * the machine's processes, and one way to stop a terminal's process.
