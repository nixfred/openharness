/**
 * Make `tmux` runnable from the daemon, not just from the user's terminal.
 *
 * Every tmux call in this CLI is `execFile('tmux', …)`, which resolves against the DAEMON's PATH.
 * That is fine while the daemon was started from a terminal and inherits the user's environment,
 * and it breaks the moment it is not: a login/launch-agent context gets a minimal PATH, Homebrew's
 * `/opt/homebrew/bin` is not on it, and every tmux call fails with ENOENT. The visible symptom is
 * agent creation failing for EVERY engine right after a reboot, since nothing else changed.
 *
 * The engine launch was already hardened against exactly this hazard — `buildEngineLaunchArgv`
 * wraps the engine in the user's interactive login shell — but the tmux calls underneath it never
 * were. This closes that asymmetry by asking the same shell where tmux is and putting its directory
 * on the daemon's PATH, once, at startup. Every existing `execFile('tmux', …)` then works unchanged.
