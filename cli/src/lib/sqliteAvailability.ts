/**
 * Can this daemon read the SQLite stores at all?
 *
 * Four engines keep their conversations in SQLite rather than in a transcript file
 * (`engines/{opencode,kilo,hermes,devin}/reader.ts`), as does one branch of session repair. They read
 * through `lib/sqliteRead`: `node:sqlite` when this Node has it (the installers' Node does), else the
 * `sqlite3` CLI. macOS ships `/usr/bin/sqlite3` in the base system; a stock `ubuntu:24.04` does NOT
 * (measured), and neither does a slim Node image — so on Linux, on a Node without the binding, those
 * four engines silently mirror nothing until the user installs it.
 *
 * Resolved from PATH directly rather than by spawning: this runs on the startup path and the answer is
 * only used for one advisory log line and to gate the one path that still needs the CLI (the opencode
 * store rewrite in `sessionModel.ts`, a write the built-in binding is not used for).
