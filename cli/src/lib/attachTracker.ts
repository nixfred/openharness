/**
 * Bookkeeping for session attaches — the reads of an agent's whole history that rebuild its live
 * normalizer (cli.ts `attachSessionNow`). Two jobs, both born of the same incident: a daemon whose
 * boot sat on ONE agent's store for good, with nothing in any log to say which.
 *
 *  - ONE attach per session at a time. The first reconcile pass after a boot starts one for every
 *    agent it reactivates, and a hook or a cursor discovery can ask for the same session while that
 *    is still running. A second fold on top of the first is the duplicate-turn class of bug (a turn
 *    opened, closed after 44ms and opened again), so a plain attach JOINS the one in flight, and a
 *    `reset` waits for it and then folds afresh.
 *  - A FEW sessions at a time. Each attach is a tmux probe, a `ps` over the whole machine and the
 *    agent's entire transcript or store; a boot with twenty agents must not start twenty at once.
 *  - Saying what the daemon is busy with. `/api/status` lists the attaches in flight, and one that
 *    runs long is logged by name.
