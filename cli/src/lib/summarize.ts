/**
 * Device turn-recap summarizer — self-contained port of the brain's `summarizeTurnText`.
 *
 * Produces the device's `recap\n\ntext` shape for one turn. Only the RECAP — a one-line headline,
 * ≤15 words — comes from a model (a disposable one-shot of the same CLI engine as the interactive
 * session). The `text` under it is the answer itself, flattened and clipped locally
 * (`deriveTurnBody`), the same excerpt `SUMMARY_MODE=local` shows: nothing on the dial reads a
 * model-written body any more (the tile shows the headline, the reader is off), the device protocol
 * defines `text` as an excerpt, and a paraphrase nobody sees cost output tokens on every turn.
 * Honors an AbortSignal so a newer turn can supersede a stale recap.
