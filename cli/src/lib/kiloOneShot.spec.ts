/**
 * A production failure, pinned.
 *
 * The kilo recap worker escaped its scratch directory and ran against the user's real repository. The
 * daemon spawns it with `cwd: <scratch>`, which is not enough: kilo resolves its project from `$PWD`, and
 * `spawn({cwd})` does not rewrite that variable, so the child inherited the DAEMON's working directory.
 * Measured in the daemon log — the worker announced
 * `kilocode-indexing workspacePath=<the daemon's launch directory> initializing project indexing` the
 * moment a prompt reached it — and reproduced by hand by setting a hostile `PWD` with the correct `cwd`.
 *
 * The consequence was not a crash. The recap sat indexing a real repository until the 60s timeout, so no
 * `turn_summary` was ever produced: no recap, and a device tile that showed "Summarizing…" for a minute
 * on every single turn. Nothing about that is visible in a unit test of the parser, which is why the
 * containment rules are asserted here instead.
