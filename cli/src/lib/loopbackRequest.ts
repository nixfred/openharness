/**
 * Whether an HTTP request to one of the daemon's loopback servers was really addressed to it.
 *
 * Binding 127.0.0.1 keeps other machines out, not other ORIGINS: a web page that re-points its own
 * hostname at 127.0.0.1 reaches these ports as a same-origin page and reads whatever answers. What it
 * cannot do is change the Host its browser sends — that stays the page's own name — so a request is
 * served only when Host names this server, and a browser request only when its Origin is that name too.
 *
 * Every native caller (the desktop app, the CLI, engine hooks, store agents) sends a loopback Host and
 * no Origin; a page the daemon served would send its own loopback origin. Nothing legitimate is refused.
