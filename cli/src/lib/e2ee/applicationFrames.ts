/** Harness-only RPC extensions. The shared, pinned crypto core remains byte-identical across clients.
 * Both the originating machine relay and receiving daemon use these classifications. Older clients
 * do not send these frames; older targets answer UNSUPPORTED before any command is attempted.
 *
 * ONE place for every extension: the grid fleet RPCs (#90), harness sharing (`SHARE_*`) and CLI-to-CLI
 * viewer forwarding (`VIEWER_DOWN_TYPES`, #85). A type listed in none of these travels plaintext, and
 * the two callers (relayClient's wrap, backendSocket's unwrap and reply) must agree — they used to
 * spell the union inline, in three places, and merging two of these features meant merging the spelling.
