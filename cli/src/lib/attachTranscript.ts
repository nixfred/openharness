/**
 * What a Claude Code or Codex transcript says about where its session stands, read from the END.
 *
 * Attaching to a session — the daemon starting, a pane opening, a reset — asks the transcript three
 * things: is a turn open and what was its prompt (the Working state, the recap and alert its end will
 * bring, the question watcher), which model, effort and mode the chips show, and, while a device
 * delivery is pending, the records that prove it landed. Every answer sits at the end of the file.
 * Reading the whole history for them cost memory in proportion to the conversation: on 2026-10-03 an
 * 803 MB Codex rollout held 1.9 GB of heap on its own, and the daemon died at its 4 GB limit seconds
 * after every start.
 *
 * So the file is walked backward to where the last turn's work began, and further only for the few
 * older records that turn still depends on, then streamed forward from there one record at a time.
 * Resuming the conversation itself stays the engine's job: nothing here loads history to show it.
 *
 * Why folding from there is the whole-history fold: a turn's beginning resets the normalizer's
 * turn-scoped state (for Codex the task's beginning, which also covers messages sent mid-task), so the
 * fold from it ends where the fold from byte 0 does. What outlives a turn is reached for explicitly
 * and bounded (`ATTACH_REACH_BYTES`): the runtime profile (`profileFrom`, `head`), the goal a
 * continuing Codex `/goal` is labelled against, and the earlier Claude tool calls whose results land
 * in the turn — already, or live, for a call still running when it opened (`seeds`). By design, and pinned by the tests:
 *  - thinking-block ids carry the window's start offset (`start`), so no two folds of one session can
 *    send the same id, and re-folding the same turn names each block as it was named before;
 *  - Codex remembers the last `/goal` objective across ordinary turns. Only a goal opener looks back for
 *    it, so when the open turn is an ordinary one, the next goal turn reads `/goal x` rather than
 *    `Continuing goal: x`. Finding it would mean reading back to BOF on every Codex attach;
 *  - a forked Codex rollout reports its own CLI version, from its first record, where the whole fold
 *    ended on the copied parent's `session_meta`.
