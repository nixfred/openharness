/**
 * Per-engine handling of the two slash commands the DEVICE can put in front of an utterance.
 *
 * The device sends a mode with each voice turn and the backend prepends the matching command, so a
 * literal `/goal <text>` or `/loop <text>` arrives here as ordinary message content (a web-typed one
 * looks identical). Injecting an unknown slash command into a CLI that has none trips a visible
 * unknown-command error in the user's terminal, so each is adapted per engine.
 *
 * The backend prepends UNCONDITIONALLY — it does not know the engine. On the routed path it picks the
 * agent only after transcribing, and its router answers without the engine; the fixed-agent and
 * route_confirm paths would each need their own lookup. This module is the one place that always knows
 * the engine (`registry.get(sessionId).engine`), so the filtering lives here for every path at once.
