/**
 * Which grid is a running agent ACTUALLY on?
 *
 * The desktop app can point an agent at a grid when it is created (`gridLaunch.ts`), and can move an
 * existing one (`agent_retarget`). Both work by changing how the engine was launched, which means the
 * answer is not in any record this daemon keeps — it is in the process. So it is read from the
 * process, the same way `gatewayRuntime.ts` reads which endpoint a pane is talking to, and for the
 * same reason: a bookkeeping map drifts the moment anything happens that the bookkeeper did not do,
 * and plenty does. A daemon restart forgets nothing. An agent the user started themselves with
 * `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=… claude` in their own shell — which this product discovers and adopts —
 * reports the truth rather than "none".
 *
 * Each engine is read through the same knob it was written through, so this table and
 * `GRID_ENGINE_CONTRACTS` must stay in step: an engine written by environment is read from the
 * environment, and Codex, which is written on the command line, is read from argv.
 *
 * **The key is never read.** The pane's credential is the pane's business; what leaves here is the
 * endpoint and the model, both of which the app already knows because it chose them.
