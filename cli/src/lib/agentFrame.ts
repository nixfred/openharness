/**
 * The one shape an agent takes on the wire.
 *
 * Every client — the web, the device, and the desktop window — rebuilds its whole agent from
 * whichever of these frames arrived last: `agents_list` replies and `agent_synced` pushes are the
 * same object, not a snapshot and a patch. So a field this function forgets is not merely missing
 * from one frame; it is ERASED on the next push from whatever an earlier frame had reported.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. This module exists because there were two hand-maintained copies of the
 * shape — one in `cli.ts` behind `agent_synced`, one in `backendSocket.ts` behind `agents_list` —
 * and `grid` was added to the second only. The desktop showed an agent's grid correctly the moment
 * it was moved, then the next reconciliation pushed a frame with no `grid` at all, the app read that
 * as "on no grid", and its "N running agents are on an older target" banner came back for agents
 * that were already exactly where the user had put them.
 *
 * Pure on purpose: the two callers own the registry, so what they know (is the terminal available,
 * which model did the runtime profile resolve) is passed in rather than looked up here. That is what
 * makes the shape testable without a registry, which is the whole reason the drift went unnoticed.
