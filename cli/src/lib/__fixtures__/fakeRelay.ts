/**
 * A fake grid relay on loopback that RECORDS every request it receives — method, path and headers — for
 * specs that must prove what the daemon sent a grid (grid-reads-without-waking). It is the spy: a spec
 * reads what arrived rather than recomputing what the code under test meant to send.
 *
 * Answers are keyed by the full request path (`/g/<grid id>/relay/v1/grid/overview`); a function answer
 * is asked on every request, so a grid can change between one read and the next.
