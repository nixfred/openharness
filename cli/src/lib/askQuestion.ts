/**
 * AskUserQuestion on a REMOTE machine — mirror the question to the device, then answer it by driving the
 * interactive CLI's own terminal dialog.
 *
 * A runtime that speaks stream-json gets this for free: a `question_request` event carries
 * the questions out and a `question_response` control-frame carries the answer back. A remote machine has no
 * such channel — the adapter watches a JSONL transcript and talks to a real TUI. So both halves read and
 * write the pane itself:
 *
 *   OUT  QuestionWatcher polls the pane while a turn is open and pushes the open dialog as
 *        `commander_question`, in the SAME shape the hosted runtime sends, so the firmware's existing question
 *        screen renders it unchanged (commanderQuestions in websocket.ts). NOT from the transcript —
 *        see the QuestionWatcher docblock for why that source cannot work.
 *   IN   the device's `question_response` → keystrokes into the pane's dialog.
 *
 * Dialog mechanics (verified against Claude Code 2.1.220, `tmux capture-pane`):
 *   - single-select : the option's digit selects AND submits, advancing to the next question / review.
 *   - free text     : the digit of the "Type something." row opens it for editing (does NOT submit) →
 *                     type the text → Enter submits.
 *   - multi-select  : rows render as `[ ]` / `[✔]`; a digit TOGGLES; Tab advances to the next question.
 *   - review        : after the last question, "Ready to submit your answers?" → "1. Submit answers".
