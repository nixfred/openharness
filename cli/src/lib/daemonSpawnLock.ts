/**
 * ONE process may spawn, hand off, or stop the daemon at a time.
 *
 * Three things used to do it with no coordination: `harness start` (the desktop app re-runs it every
 * few seconds whenever the daemon looks down), the daemon's own self-update handoff, and
 * `harness update`. The control port is fixed, so two spawners in the same second is a coin toss for
 * which child binds — and the loser, having already written its pid, either left `adapter.pid`
 * naming a corpse or deleted the file that named the winner. That is the orphan on :18473 that
 * `harness stop` cannot see and every later `harness start` trips over.
 *
 * Same shape as the registry lock (a directory created with mkdir + an `owner.json` written O_EXCL,
 * reclaimed only when the owning process is provably gone), with three differences it needs:
 *  - waiting is ASYNC — the daemon takes this lock on its own event loop during a handoff, and the
 *    registry's `Atomics.wait` would freeze it;
 *  - it is RE-ENTRANT within a process — `harness update` calls `launch()`, `harness start` stages
 *    the bundle and then calls `launch()`, and the updater's tick runs the whole handoff — each of
 *    those is one critical section, not two;
 *  - it is released on `process.exit`, because the CLI exits from a dozen places inside the section.
 *
 * There is deliberately NO age-based staleness. A holder is a holder for as long as its process is
 * alive — a handoff supervises the new build for up to a minute and a download on a slow link can
 * take longer — and the only thing an age bound would buy is letting a second spawner in while the
 * first is still working, which is the bug this exists to prevent. The escape hatch is
 * `harness stop`, which waits its turn and then proceeds regardless.
