/**
 * Hand this computer's Harness access token to the `grid` CLI, so signing in to a grid needs no
 * second browser.
 *
 * **Every kind of sign-in goes to `grid`, and `grid` alone says no.** A browser sign-in holds an
 * Autonomous token; a computer signed in by QR holds a Harness-issued sign-in, whose token starts
 * `hna_`. This module used to refuse the second before `grid` was asked, because the control plane
 * could only read Autonomous tokens and a QR-signed computer was told to sign in again with Google or
 * Apple. The control plane now asks the Harness backend who holds either kind (autonomous-grid ADR
 * 0046), and a sign-in it cannot take — one that has lapsed, or an account whose Google identity
 * Harness has not yet learned — comes back as `grid`'s own refusal, which names its own way forward.
 * A check here would only be a second copy of that rule to fall out of step with it.
 *
 * The seam is a child process and nothing else: `grid login --harness` reads the token off its own
 * standard input, exchanges it at the control plane, and owns everything after that. This module's
 * whole job is to run that child honestly — put the credential somewhere a process listing cannot
 * reach, let its output and its exit code through, and turn the one exit code that means something
 * specific into a sentence.
 *
 * **Standard input, never argv and never the environment.** An argument would put a live account
 * credential into `ps` output for every user on the machine, for the life of the call; an environment
 * variable would put it in `/proc/<pid>/environ` and in anything the child later spawns.
