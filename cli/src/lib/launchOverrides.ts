/**
 * What a pane has to be launched WITH, beyond the engine's own argv, for the engine to come back
 * where it was: on the same grid with the same credential, or under the same Codex profile.
 *
 * `agent_create` assembles this from the desktop's fresh `GridLaunchOverride`. Every later relaunch of
 * the same agent — a restart in place, a pane recreated after a reboot — has to assemble the SAME
 * thing from what the registry kept (`gridLaunch`, `codexHome`), or the engine silently comes back on
 * its own login, spending the wrong account while looking identical. Written once so the three
 * callers cannot drift: the half that drifts is the half nobody ran today.
 *
 * Dependency-injected like restoreAgents.ts, because the two machine-specific parts (the tmux version
 * probe and the config directory writer) are exactly the parts worth stubbing in a spec.
