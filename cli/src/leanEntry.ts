/**
 * The lean bundle's entry: harnessd's master and its services, and nothing else (harnessd/leanBundle.ts).
 *
 * Built a second time, on its own, and carried inside cli.js, so that the master and each service start
 * on their own code instead of the whole CLI's 4.4 MB: Node parses every byte of the files a process
 * loads, and the whole CLI cost each of them about 45 MiB at idle. Built split, each dynamic import below
 * a file of its own with what only it uses, so a process loads this file, its own and the shared ones it
 * imports: the master never the services' code, a service never the master's nor another service's
 * (leanEntry.spec.ts holds it to that). A master started on cli.js re-executes on this file
 * (masterProcess.ts `startMasterFromBundle`) and starts the services from it. The core has an entry of
 * its own, built apart (leanCoreEntry.ts), and the CLI always runs from cli.js.
