// The daemon as a DEVICE on the backend's device plane, held on the dial's behalf.
//
// This is the only thing in the CLI that reaches a machine that is not this computer. It exists because
// the dial has no network of its own: everything it can ask for about another machine is asked here and
// answered back over the cable.
//
// ── WHAT THIS IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// It is NOT the daemon's own backend socket. `BackendSocket` (/api/adapter-ws) holds the NODE role for
// this computer's machine and is the sole writer of its down-channel; this holds the COMMANDER role on
// somebody else's. Different endpoint, different role, different lifetime — and no conflict, because the
// backend keys hub clients by (machineId, kind).
//
// Three rules, each paid for:
//
//   1. THE LOCAL MACHINE NEVER COMES THROUGH HERE. Its agents are in this process. Routing them to a dial
//      plugged into this very computer via the cloud would add a round trip, a failure mode and an
//      audience, for nothing. `attach()` refuses it outright rather than trusting callers.
//
//   2. NEVER CLEAR THE AUTH SESSION. `BackendSocket.onRevoked` owns that decision. Two sockets racing to
//      wipe a session on the same 401 is a bug waiting for a bad afternoon; a dead DeviceLink must
//      degrade to "other machines unavailable" and leave the cabled machine working. It holds no session
//      either: its tokens come from the core's (`core.account.accessToken`), and its E2EE sessions are the
//      gateway's, which holds this machine's identity (`core.account.lane`, gateway/lane.ts).
//
//   3. LOG EVERY ERROR AND EVERY DROPPED FRAME. This feature's characteristic bug is SILENT EMPTINESS —
//      an RPC answered with an error nobody printed, a card arriving in a shape nobody recognised. All of
//      them render as "the carousel is empty", and none of them says so anywhere by default.
