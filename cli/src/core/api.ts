/**
 * The boundary the services stand on (docs/design/2026-10-03-harnessd.md, "The core boundary"):
 * `CoreApi` is what a service may ask of the core, and `CorePorts` is what the core asks of services.
 *
 * Both are in process today. When a service moves into a process of its own, its `CoreApi` calls
 * become requests on the local socket and its port becomes a proxy that sends them; the service's
 * code stays as it is. Members are added as services move behind it, each a call that exists today,
 * never a generic `call(name, args)`.
 *
 * The apps reach a service through the requests it answers (`ServiceRequests`), which its start
 * returns. The core routes them to it; a port is only for what the core itself must ask.
