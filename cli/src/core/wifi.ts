/**
 * The Wi-Fi device, as the core keeps it. The device's service runs with the dials, in the devices'
 * process (services/wifi.ts, step 9, D3); what stays here is what the core reads in line, kept from what
 * the service tells it, and the checks on what the service sends a device:
 *
 * - **Presence.** Which device sessions said their app's hello, by connection: a device watching means the
 *   core makes the turn cards and recaps for it, as it reads in line on every card. The core keeps them, so
 *   a service that starts again is handed the devices it was serving and serves them on (`WifiResume`).
 * - **The transcripts it proves its turns by.** Every transcript line of every agent is too much to send
 *   to another process; the service reads only those of an agent it sent a prompt to, until that prompt's
 *   turn is proven. The core starts sending an agent's lines as it dispatches the prompt, before the service
 *   could ask, and stops when the service says it is done with the agent as of the last prompt it was told
 *   of: never in the gap between a prompt and the service hearing of it.
 * - **The live text it streams.** The answer's text goes always (a device subscribing mid-turn is sent the
 *   whole final, as before), a tool's events only for an agent a device subscribed to; the service says
 *   which before the subscription's answer leaves it, so no event in between is lost.
 * - **The focus revision** a window's delayed selection is checked against, as the service last said it;
 *   none while it is off, so a selection is refused then, as it was with no service.
 * - **Each answer goes to the session it came from:** the core seals it to a session only while that
 *   session is still the same identity's device.
 * - **What a device sends while its service is not there** (its process starting at the first device, or
 *   starting again) is held, in order, and handed on once the service has been resumed; a session, a
 *   request or a pairing asks for the process (core/devicesWake.ts).
