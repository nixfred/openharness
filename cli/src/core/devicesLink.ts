/**
 * The devices in a process of their own (services/devicesProcess.ts), as the core sees them: the port the
 * core calls (`DevicesPort`) and what the core answers when the devices ask (docs/design/2026-10-06-core-
 * boundary-next.md, step 9, D2).
 *
 * The core never waits on them. What it tells them (a card, the desk, a window's answer) is a notice on
 * their link, dropped while they are down, since the core keeps the state they need and says it again
 * when they connect. What it asks of them (⌘K, the Wi-Fi device's step along the desk) is a request on
 * the link with a deadline and an answer for when they do not give one: a hung devices process costs ⌘K
 * its answer, never a window's typing or an agent's turn.
 *
 * What they ask of the core is the core's API, as a service in the core's process would call it: this
 * computer's agents as the dial lists them (asked as the dial's tick or ⌘K needs them, and with them this
 * computer, the sign-in and whether a window is there), a turn, a stop, an answer, a pane's activity line,
 * a token for the transcriber and the fleet's lane, the lane's sealing (the gateway's), the machine list,
 * and the frames for the windows.
 * The one-way ones come as notices, the rest as queries.
