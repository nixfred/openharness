/**
 * The DSH viewers in their own process, as the core sees them (`HARNESSD_SERVICES=viewers`; the
 * process's side is services/viewersProcess.ts).
 *
 * The core asks the viewers two things while it builds an agent's frame: what its DSH context is (its
 * harness's name, its viewer URL, its verdict) and where the windows' viewer pane forwards to. A frame
 * cannot wait on another process, so the viewers tell the core each agent's answers whenever they change
 * (a `service_query` of kind `context`), the core keeps the last of them here, and the port answers from
 * that: while the process is down, with what it last knew, or the fallbacks for an agent it never heard
 * of. Each change then does in the core what the viewers did in their process: the frame of an agent
 * whose terminal is attached goes out again. (A viewer that moved used to move the core's streams to it
 * too; they are the viewers' own now, and follow it in their process.)
 *
 * Attach and detach go to the process as notifications (`service_event`). A detach it missed would leave
 * a viewer running, so it is held until the process hears it. An attach it missed is caught up instead:
 * the process asks for every agent with a harness (`agents`) each time it connects, which a restarted
 * process needs anyway, since it starts holding nothing. Holding attaches as well would only pile up the
 * core's repeats (one per agent on every discovery pass) while the process is down.
 *
 * The core keeps what it hears only for the agents it has attached and not since detached: what the
 * process says of an agent before it hears the agent's detach must not bring the forgotten agent's
 * viewer back. The process says everything again on each attach, which is how the core's first word on
 * an agent arrives after a core restart, when the process connects before the core has attached anyone.
 *
 * A client served a viewer over its connection (core/viewerStreams.ts): each frame of its stream is told
 * to the process as it comes, never held (a stream dies with the process that held it), and refused
 * instead while the process is not reading, so a hung one cannot pile a client's uploads up in the core.
 * What the stream answers comes back as a notice for that connection; one the core cannot deliver ends
 * that stream in the process, as a frame the forwarder could not send ended it in the core's. A rendered
 * frame (`viewer_surface`) is asked of the process (`surface`), and answered unavailable, as a routed
 * request is, if it is down or slower than a client waits.
 *
 * The process runs on demand (core/viewersWake.ts): an agent with a harness attached asks for it, and so does a
 * client's stream that comes before it has ever connected to this core. That stream's frames are held, in order and
 * bounded, until it connects, as a request to a service on demand waits for it (core/serviceLinks.ts `onDemand`), and
 * refused if it has not come within a start's wait. Once it has connected, a stream is refused at once while it is
 * down, as before: a process that went down is the master's to bring back, and a client waits for nobody meanwhile.
 * Held, a stream that woke a process with no viewer yet is refused by the viewers themselves; one that came while a
 * running process reconnects to a core that restarted is served.
