/**
 * Hosting services in the core's process so that a failing one cannot take the core down with it
 * (docs/design/2026-10-03-harnessd.md, the core boundary). In process, a service shares the core's
 * heap and event loop; this is the isolation a function boundary can give, and a service moved out
 * of process gets the rest.
 *
 * - **Start.** A service whose start throws is left off: its port stays null, it is logged, and the
 *   core starts without it.
 * - **Calls.** Every call into a port is guarded. One that throws, or whose promise rejects, is logged
 *   and answered with that member's fallback, so the core's caller (the event funnel, restore, a
 *   frame being built) carries on. A member whose fallback is `FAIL` answers a request: its failure
 *   goes back to that one request, which the socket answers with an error.
 * - **Requests.** A service answers the apps through the requests it declares when it is started;
 *   its start returns their handlers, and the socket asks `route` before its own switch, so a feature
 *   adds a request without touching the socket. While the service is off they are answered
 *   `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`, never `UNSUPPORTED`, which the apps read as "update the CLI": that is why
 *   the types are declared before the start that could fail. A handler that throws or rejects is
 *   answered `SERVICE_FAILED`, and counts as a failure of the service like a call into its port.
 * - **Switching off.** A service that fails `maxFailures` times within `windowMs` is switched off
 *   for the rest of the daemon's life: it is stopped when its port can stop, its port goes null, the
 *   core's calls answer their fallbacks without reaching it, its requests are answered unavailable,
 *   and the `onOff` handlers unbind what clients reach it through. A restart of the daemon starts it
 *   again.
