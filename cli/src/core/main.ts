 * The core's entry: `harness __run`. `runForeground` is the composition root, which builds the core's
 * modules, starts the services through `serviceHost` and wires them to the socket
 * (cli/AGENTS.md). It moved here from cli.ts verbatim, with what only it uses, so that the core's process
 * is measured from its own entry rather than from the CLI's (docs/design/2026-10-06-core-boundary-next.md,
 * step 1); `src/architecture.spec.ts` walks the imports from this file and holds them to a budget.
 *
 * cli.ts stays the process's entry and the CLI: it parses the command and, for `__run` (and a start under tsx,
 * or `start -f` with `HARNESS_NO_MASTER=1`), calls in here. `start -f` runs harnessd's master, which starts
 * the core with `__run`.

   * The other is which OpenCode is installed: v2's TUI exits 1 on v1's `-m` / `--agent`. Cached per
