/**
 * Attach: start following a session. The first attach of a session reads its history into its engine's
 * normalizer — Claude Code and Codex from the end of the transcript (lib/attachTranscript.ts), the other
 * file engines whole, the database engines through a reader that then polls — replays only a turn still
 * open, and hands the tail the byte the read stopped at. A later attach of a session it already follows
 * only makes sure the tail is running. One attach per session at a time, a few sessions at a time.
