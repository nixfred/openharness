/**
 * Recaps, as the core keeps them: only the turn's lifecycle, told to the recaps service as it happens
 * (services/recaps.ts, through `RecapsPort`), and what it holds of a session, read back in line. The cards
 * on the dial and in the window, the notifications on the phone and the recap files are the service's.
 *
 * The core never waits on it. Each call below is a notice the service may miss, or a read of what it last
 * said (in its own process, core/recapsLink.ts), or none while it is off: then a turn has no recap and
 * no card, and nothing else changes. A recap is stored under the engine session and asked for by agent.
 *
 * `mirror` keeps the calls the rest of the core made into the commander mirror when it ran here, so the
 * funnel, the heartbeats, cancel, fork, binding and purge each say what happened in their own words.
