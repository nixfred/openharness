/**
 * Engine errors, rewritten for a 1.9" round screen.
 *
 * A CLI writes for someone sitting at a terminal: it links to a settings page, quotes a trace id, tells
 * you to check the pane. None of that is actionable on a device — the reader cannot follow a URL, and a
 * long sentence pushes the one fact that matters off the card. So each rule here keeps the WHAT and the
 * WHEN and drops the rest, rather than truncating, which cuts the end — where the useful part usually is.
 *
 * The core writes these into the cards it sends every device (core/turns/funnel.ts, core/input.ts), so
 * the text is the core's: a device, in its own process, draws what it is sent.
