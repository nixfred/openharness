 *

 * end-to-end suite's first Linux runs (#843): zsh's new-user menu kept out of an agent's pane
 * (lib/engineLaunch.ts), a hook's ancestry read as it arrives (core/engines/hooks.ts), and a relaunch
 * that must stay up to count (core/agents/swap.ts).
 *
 * Grew by 58 for the turn a blocking Stop hook continues (a Claude /goal loop): it is the turn lifecycle,
 * which only the core's transcript normalizer and Stop-hook fallback can keep.
 *
 * Then at 102,019 in 430 with #893's shell launch (step 5), from 106,006 in 451: search, the viewers, workspaces, usage, the
 * monitor and the project readers run in processes of their own, and their code is loaded into the
 * core's only when they run there instead (services/inline.ts). Then at 101,896 in 430 (step 6): the
 * Store runs beside the viewers.
 *
 * Grew to 102,524 in 433 (step 10, R1), from 101,896 in 430: the relay and its E2EE left the socket for
 * the gateway (gateway/gateway.ts, gateway/upstream.ts) behind the two interfaces it speaks to the core
 * through (`GatewayPort`, `GatewayEvents` in core/api.ts), still in the core's process. The socket lost
 * 742 lines; the gateway's 1,193 and the interfaces' 110 are loaded until R2 runs the gateway in a process
 * of its own, which takes them, the E2EE manager and the P2P channels out of the core's process.
 *
 * Then at 95,689 in 420 (step 10, R2), from 102,524 in 433: the gateway runs in a process of its own (gateway/gatewayProcess.ts),
 * and the core loads it only to run it in its own process instead (services/inline.ts). With it went the
 * E2EE manager, the backend link, P2P and STUN, the windows' relay pool, the trust group and the device
 * key log. What of lib/e2ee the core still loads is the fleet's lane (R3) and Share's own crypto (step 8).
 *
 * Grew by 67 to 95,757 in 420 for the daemon's periodic CPU, measured on harnessd-core 0.3.58/0.3.59: the
 * dial scan runs `ioreg` (~150 ms of CPU every 2 s, about 7.5% of a core) only when /dev/cu.* changes
 * (cable/serial.ts, +31, with one confirming scan after each change or phantom port, since devfs and the
 * IORegistry do not change together); a deleted executable already found by `lsof -d txt` (~18 ms every
 * 5 s, about 0.4%) is not asked about again every 5 s (lib/tmux.ts and lib/nativeProcessImages.ts,
 * +32); and an unchanged registry.json is not rewritten every 5 s (about 720 writes an hour) because
 * its keys were in another order (lib/registry.ts, +4). The dial's part leaves with step 9 (the devices
 * process).

// Connected TUI shells added a literal-argv launch port and shell service (#893, 160 loaded lines); moving

//
// Then at 95,340 in 416 (step 10, R3), from 95,757 in 420: the fleet's lane seals through the gateway, so
// the session crypto it ran in the core's process (lib/e2ee/relayClient.ts and what it loads) is the
// gateway's alone, and the Share relay (sharing/relay.ts) runs in the gateway with the relay's other sockets.
// What a service in its own process may ask of the account (core/accountQueries.ts) is the 41 lines added.
//
// Then at 95,374 in 417 (step 11), from 95,380: a core on its own hands an update to a master on the new
// build, which judges it, instead of spawning a core and judging it itself. Not the 180 lines the plan
// counted on: a core still runs without a master when an older release's own handoff started it.
//
// Then at 89,632 in 401 (step 7), from 95,374 in 417: models runs in a process of its own, the Jev catalog's
// 97 lines (#888) with it, and the core reaches grid only through its port (core/modelsLink.ts), keeping
// which `grid` a pane runs (lib/gridBinary.ts), how a frame reads a grid's note (lib/gridAnnotation.ts) and
// the launchers (lib/launchers.ts).
//
// Then at 89,761 in 402 (step 8, its first change), from 89,632 in 401: delivered turns (core/deliveries.ts), the one way the Wi-Fi

// processes of their own. Its lines are added here, ahead of the moves that take the teams and the
// orchestrator out of this process.
//
// Then at 89,443 in 402, from 89,796 in 402: the orchestrator is an experiment, in a process of its own
// started only once it is on (services/orchestratorProcess.ts); its 640 lines leave. What stays is what any
// experiment acts on the core through (core/experiments.ts, core/experimentQueries.ts) and what the core
// keeps of the orchestrator (core/orchestratorLink.ts): 290 lines.
//
// Then at 88,080 in 392, from 89,443 in 402: Tab collaboration and teams are an experiment, in the teams'
// process beside the prompt scopes (services/collaborationProcess.ts), started only once on; the team
// service, its mailbox, the tab channels and their wire (1,700 lines) leave. What stays: the team write hold
// the core reads a pane with as it writes a team's turn, now lib/teamWriteHold.ts, and what the core keeps of
// the teams' process (core/teamsLink.ts: which deliveries may be written, the scopes' own questions) and of
// the account's notices (core/experiments.ts).
//
// Then at 87,476 in 387, from 88,083 in 392: Share is an experiment, in a process of its own started only
// once on (services/sharingProcess.ts), holding no credential: the owner, its stores, its crypto and the
// identity store it signed with leave. Its welcomes are signed by the gateway (gateway/observerKey.ts), and
// its observers' terminals are read by the core's read-only stream manager (core/terminalWatch.ts), which
// stays with what the core keeps of Share (core/sharingLink.ts).
//
// Grew to 87,941 in 389 (step 9, D1), from 87,476 in 387: the devices behind a port of their own, still in
// the core's process (services/devices.ts, services/devicesGuard.ts, the port and its `CoreApi` members in
// core/api.ts). runForeground lost their wiring and the pane writer lock came into the core
// (core/deviceInput.ts). D2 runs the devices in a process of their own, which takes them out: the dial,
// the window bridges, the fleet's router and lane, and the voice router, about 10,000 lines.
//
// Then at 77,669 in 358 (step 9, D2), from 87,941 in 389: the devices run in a process of their own
// (services/devicesProcess.ts; the core's side is core/devicesLink.ts), and the core loads their code only
// to run them in its process instead (services/inline.ts). With them went the dial (cable/), the window
// bridges, the fleet's router and its lane to the owner's other machines, and the voice router with its
// engine worker pool, and the E2EE code the fleet read the linked machines with (lib/e2ee/machinePeers.ts).
//
// Then at 75,746 in 345 (step 9, D3), from 77,669 in 358: the Wi-Fi device's service, its relay, its
// receipts and streams and its Store preparations run with the dials (services/wifi.ts, in the devices'
// process; the core's side is core/wifi.ts and core/wifiLink.ts), and with them went the Store's installs
// and catalog, which only the device's preparations reached from the core.
//
// Then at 75,456 in 344, from 75,746 in 345: the web dashboard (webui.ts, `GET /`, its log tail and stop
// button, and its port in `e2e_status`) is deleted. Nothing opened it: no app, website, script or the
// backend, and the web client that linked to it retired with the browser setup links (#348).
//
// Grew by 37 to 75,493 in 344, from 75,456, for the notice that the connection a routed request came over closed
// (core/serviceHost.ts, core/serviceLinks.ts, the socket's close paths), held requests for an experiment
// still starting included: what lets a service keep work per connection and stop it when its asker goes,
// which held the command bar's two doors in the core (step 4).
//
// Then at 74,974 in 342, from 75,493 in 344: what serves this machine's viewers to a client over its
// connection (lib/viewerForwarder.ts, lib/interactiveViewer.ts and the stream they run on, lib/viewerWire.ts)
// runs in the viewers' process, beside the viewer servers it forwards to (services/viewers.ts), and with it
// the headless browser capture the surfaces render with (sharing/viewer.ts), Share's other user. The core
// keeps the frame types it gates (lib/viewerFrames.ts) and hands each frame on (core/viewerStreams.ts).
//
// Then at 74,629 in 340, from 74,974 in 342: the command bar is an experiment, in a process of its own
// from its first request (services/commandBar.ts); its JEV decisions with their zod schemas
// (lib/commandBar.ts) and the OpenRouter key reader only it still loaded here (lib/openrouter.ts) leave.
// Its HTTP door stays, forwarding to it (lib/commandBarHttp.ts), and so does ⌘K's task delivery, the
// devices'.
//
// Quiet-machine QA moves handoff history folding, redaction and file writes to the edge host;
// the core keeps narrow conversation reads: 73,025 lines in 336 files after the command-bar extraction.
//
// Grew by 229 to 73,254 in 337 (step 9, the devices on demand), from 73,025 in 336: the devices' process runs
// only once there is a device, about 72 MiB at idle that a computer with none no longer pays. What asks for
// it is the core's (core/devicesWake.ts, 146: a dial's port in /dev every two seconds, a paired Wi-Fi
// device); a Wi-Fi device's requests are held while it starts (core/wifi.ts, +50), and a process on demand
// that did not come in time is answered at once (core/serviceLinks.ts).
//
// Grew by 157 to 73,411 in 338, from 73,254 in 337: the gate that keeps a terminal attaching apart from what
// tmux tells every terminal (lib/tmuxControlGate.ts and its uses in the terminal stream, the pastes, and
// session create, kill and rename). Before tmux 3.7 the two meeting crashed the tmux server, and every agent
// with it (windows.e2e.ts, 7 of 27 CI runs on Ubuntu's 3.4). It guards the core's own terminals, so it
// cannot move to a service. The budget keeps the 101 lines of room it had.
//
// Then at 72,134 in 333, from 73,411 in 338: the updater left the core for a process the master runs
// (services/updaterProcess.ts), and the core never downloads a build. The CLI's and hn's updaters
// (lib/selfUpdate.ts, tui/update.ts, tui/install.ts) went, with the spawn lock they staged under.
//
// Then at 71,244 in 332, from 72,134 in 333: the recaps (each turn's recap, the devices' turn cards and the
// notification a finished turn rings: lib/commander.ts and lib/agentNotifications.ts) run as a service, in
// the edge host by default (services/recaps.ts). The core keeps the turn lifecycle it tells them, a port
