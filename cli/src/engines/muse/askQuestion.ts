/**
 * Muse Code's ask-the-user dialog.
 *
 * Captured live (muse 0.1.0-R708.1) — the shared Claude parser gets three things wrong on it, which is
 * why this exists:
 *
 *   Bạn thích màu chủ đề nào: Xanh hay Đỏ?          ← the question
 *   ┌─ Preview ──────────────────────────────┐      ← a PREVIEW of the answer being hovered; the shared
 *   │ Bạn chọn Xanh làm màu chủ đề.          │        parser mistook its bottom border for the question
 *   └────────────────────────────────────────┘
 *   › 1. Xanh               Tông màu xanh mát mẻ     ← label and description are one line, split by a
 *     2. Đỏ                 Tông màu đỏ nổi bật        run of spaces — not a separate line as in claude
 *     3. None of the above  Optionally, add details    ← selecting this opens a note editor, and the
 *   Enter to select · ↑/↓ to move · Tab for a note       device has no text input, so never offer it
 *
 * The preview box also means the answer text appears on screen BEFORE anything is chosen, so a naive
 * "read the last box" approach would report the hovered option as if the user had picked it.

 * The dialog's footer, and ONLY the dialog's. It is one line:
 *
 *   Enter to select · ↑/↓ to move · Tab for an optional note · Esc to interrupt
 *
 * `esc to interrupt` used to be a third alternative here. It is a SUFFIX of that same line, so it bought
 * nothing — and it is also what muse prints on its own status line for any RUNNING turn (see
 * sessionInput.ts, which relies on exactly that). Any turn whose output happened to contain numbered
 * lines therefore anchored here and was scraped into a question that nobody asked: reading an HTML file
 * with a numbered feature list produced the "question" `• 5 Features:` on the device while the terminal
 * showed no dialog at all.
 *
 * `enter to select` is the robust anchor of the two kept: the line is long, and a narrow pane truncates
 * from the END, which takes `Esc to interrupt` first and leaves this untouched.
