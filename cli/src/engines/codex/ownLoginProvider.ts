/**
 * Undoing the provider a grid launch left behind in Codex's own state.
 *
 * Codex does not resolve its provider from argv alone. From 0.155 it records one PER THREAD in
 * `<CODEX_HOME>/state_5.sqlite` (`threads.model_provider`), written at launch from whatever
 * `-c model_provider=` said. The grid contract says `grid` there (`gridLaunch.ts`), and defines what
 * `grid` means in the SAME argv — so the name is persisted while its definition is not.
 *
 * Move the agent back to its own login and that asymmetry is the bug: the harness correctly stops
 * passing every `-c model_providers.grid.*`, `codex resume` loads the thread row, and resolving it
 * fails before the TUI is up —
 *
 *   thread/resume failed: failed to load configuration: Model provider `grid` not found (code -32600)
 *
 * — which the daemon can only answer by giving up on the session and starting a fresh one
 * ("[restart] codex did not come back up resuming its session — retrying fresh"). The conversation
 * survives on disk and is never reached again, which is exactly what `subscriptionModel.ts` and
 * `portableHistory.ts` exist to prevent.
 *
 * So the move back names a provider too, rather than only un-naming the grid's. Measured against
 * codex-cli 0.155.1: argv OUTRANKS the stored row, so this repairs a thread that is already
 * poisoned rather than only keeping the next one clean — no database is read, written, or migrated.
 *
 * ## Why the user's own config is read first
 *
 * `openai` is Codex's default, not its only answer: a `model_provider` at the top of the user's
 * `config.toml` is their standing choice for every Codex they run, and a harness that overwrote it
 * with `openai` would move them off their own provider as the price of leaving a grid. So the file
 * is asked first and `openai` is the fallback — the same value Codex itself would have picked.
