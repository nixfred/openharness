 * `opencode models` prints one `provider/model` per line on stdout, and that is the whole catalog:
 *
 *   opencode/ling-3.0-flash-free
 *   opencode-go/kimi-k3
 *   vibe/minimax/minimax-m3
 *
 * OpenCode has **no effort axis** — every option is `@auto`, and the label is the model alone.
 *
 * Switching is a picker (`/models`), but unlike Command Code's it accepts typed input, which is what
 * makes it safe to drive: type a filter, and act only once the list has narrowed to exactly ONE row.
 * Never arrow blindly through it — that is what the Command Code revert (2026-07-30) was about.
 * The filter matches across the model AND provider columns, which is how two rows that share a model
 * name (`MiniMax-M3` on OpenCode Go vs `MiniMax M3 (vibe)` on Vibe Gateway) are told apart.
