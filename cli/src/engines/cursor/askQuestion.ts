/**
 * Cursor's permission prompt — the only dialog cursor ever blocks a person on.
 *
 * It ships no ask-the-user tool at all (asked to use one, cursor answers that no MCP server provides it),
 * so unlike every other engine this file has no question parser to sit beside. Captured live from
 * cursor-agent 2026.08.11 (`__fixtures__/permission-cursor.txt`):
 *
 *   ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *    $  curl -s https://example.com in .              ← the command, and the directory it runs in
 *
 *    Run this command?
 *    Not in allowlist: curl                           ← why it is asking
 *     → Run (once) (y)
 *       Add Shell(curl) to allowlist? (tab)
 *       Run Everything (shift+tab)
 *       Skip & tell the agent what to do instead (esc or n)
 *
 * What makes cursor its own parser is the third selection mechanism in this codebase. Claude numbers its
 * rows and a digit submits; amp and kilo number nothing and are walked with arrows; cursor numbers
 * nothing either but **every row states its own key in a trailing parenthesis**. So the key is read off
 * the row and carried in `number`, which is exactly what `rowKeys` presses — no walk, no digit, no engine
 * branch in the driver.
 *
 * Two details worth stating, because both are choices rather than transcriptions:
 *
 *   - `(esc or n)` becomes **`n`**, never `Escape`. Esc is also the pane's own cancel and on a busy
 *     cursor pane it does more than decline the prompt; the letter only ever answers this dialog.
 *   - `Run Everything` is KEPT, even though it disables approvals for the rest of the session. It is
 *     cursor's own wording for the same escape hatch claude spells "don't ask again" and amp spells
 *     "Allow All for Every Session", and hiding one engine's version of a row the others all offer would
 *     be a silent behaviour difference, not a safety feature. Tapping it stays the person's decision.
 *
 * There is no footer under the rows — the pane simply ends at the last option, the way Command Code's
 * dialog does — so the frame's opening rule is the anchor at both ends.
 *
 * One fixture covers cursor because cursor has exactly one gate. Probed on a live pane: editing a file in
 * the workspace, and even writing one OUTSIDE it (`/private/tmp/…`), both run unprompted once the
 * workspace is trusted. Only a shell command absent from the allowlist stops for a person — so unlike
 * claude, there is no second `Edit file` shape waiting to be missed.
