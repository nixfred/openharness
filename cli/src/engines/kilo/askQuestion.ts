/**
 * Kilo's ask-the-user dialog — which, like amp's, is a PERMISSION prompt rather than a question tool.
 *
 * This is the one place kilo's pane diverges hardest from the opencode it forked. OpenCode draws Claude's
 * numbered dialog inside a box, so the shared parser fits once the border is peeled. Kilo does not: it
 * lays its options out HORIZONTALLY on a single line, unnumbered, sharing that line with the key hints.
 * Captured live from a real pane (an `external_directory` rule set to `ask`, which is kilo's default for
 * anything outside the project — so this prompt is not an edge case, it is what a web-driven agent hits
 * the first time it reads a path outside its own directory):
 *
 *   ┃  △ Permission required
 *   ┃    ← Access external directory /private/etc
 *   ┃
 *   ┃  Patterns
 *   ┃
 *   ┃  - /private/etc/*
 *   ┃
 *   ┃   Allow once   Allow always   Reject      ctrl+f fullscreen  ⇆ select  enter confirm
 *
 * Four measured properties drive everything below:
 *
 *   - **Options and footer share one line**, separated from each other by runs of spaces. Splitting on
 *     whitespace alone would hand the device `ctrl+f fullscreen` as a selectable answer, so the hint
 *     segments are removed by name before the labels are read.
 *   - **The options are not numbered**, so nothing can be answered by pressing a digit. `number` carries
 *     the row's INDEX and `kiloSelectionKeys` turns it into a walk — with `Right`, not `Down`: the footer
 *     says `⇆ select`, and the layout is horizontal.
 *   - **The selected row is marked only in ANSI.** Verified against the raw capture: `Allow once` is drawn
 *     on the amber accent background (`48;2;204;167;0`) while the others sit on grey. A plain
 *     `capture-pane -p` keeps none of that, so the walk assumes the dialog opens on the FIRST row — the
 *     same assumption amp's parser makes, and the reason a walk is computed rather than a jump.
 *   - **The box has a left rail only** (`┃`), not a full border, so peeling is one-sided.
 *
 * `Reject` is kept for the same reason amp's `Reject with feedback` is: dropping it would leave a device
 * user two ways to say yes and none to say no. Neither of the "allow" rows is preferred here — choosing
 * between "once" and "always" is a policy decision that belongs to the person, not to this parser.
