/**
 * WHICH HERMES HOME A SESSION LIVES IN.
 *
 * Hermes keeps history in ONE SQLite store per home — and a machine has more than one home. `hermes -p
 * <name>` runs against `~/.hermes/profiles/<name>`, with its own `config.yaml`, its own `auth.json` and
 * its own `state.db`. The daemon used to read `<HERMES_HOME>/state.db` everywhere, so a fleet of profile
 * agents streamed their terminals perfectly and then sat on "No activity yet" forever: the mirror polled
 * a database their sessions were not in, so no turn ever opened, nothing was ever recapped, and
 * `agent_recent` answered zero for the life of the agent (openharness#191).
 *
 * ⚠️ **THE SESSION ID IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT NEEDS NO ASSUMPTION.** The obvious fix is to read
 * `HERMES_HOME` off the live process, the way `codexHomeProbe` reads `CODEX_HOME` — and that is done
 * below, because it is free when it works. But whether Hermes exports it for a `-p` session is the
 * engine's business and changes between versions, and a pane the daemon did not create may be gone by
 * the time anyone asks. A session id is unique and its row exists in exactly one store, so "which home
 * holds this session" is answerable by looking, at the cost of one indexed lookup per home, once per
 * agent — the answer is then filled onto the registry row and never asked again (see
 * `RegisteredSession.hermesHome`).
 *
 * Nothing here writes. Discovering a home does not create one, and a home with no `state.db` is not a
 * home yet — it is a profile whose first session has not started.
