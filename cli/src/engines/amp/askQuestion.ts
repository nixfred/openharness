/**
 * Amp's ask-the-user dialog — which is a PERMISSION prompt, not a question tool.
 *
 * Amp ships no ask-the-user tool at all (measured: 33 tools in a real session's `system/init`, none of
 * them asks anything). The only time it blocks on a person is when a permission rule says `ask`, and it
 * draws this, captured live:
 *

 *   │ ‣ Allow Once                                          │   ← selection is a MARKER, not a number
 *   │   Reject with feedback                                │
 *   │   Allow All for This Session                          │

 *
 * Three things separate it from every other engine's dialog:
 *
 *   - **The options are not numbered.** Nothing can be answered by pressing a digit; the caller has to
 *     walk the list with `Down` and commit with `Enter`. `number` therefore carries the row's INDEX, and
 *     `ampSelectionKeys` turns it into that walk.
 *   - **The options are fixed**, so the row list is the same for every approval.
 *   - **Nothing records it.** The thread log logs an approval queue with a COUNT and no content, and the
 *     server export has no trace of a pending approval. The pane is the only place it exists.
 *
 * `Reject with feedback` is deliberately KEPT even though it opens a free-text editor the device cannot
 * type into. Dropping it — the rule the other engines' "None of the above" follows — would leave a device
 * user with four ways to say yes and none to say no.
