/**
 * The teams on a socket, for the teams' own specs written against it (teams/remote.spec.ts,
 * teams/transport.spec.ts) when the team features were the socket's: its state folder and command
 * (`teamStateDir`, `teamCommand`), its prompt scopes (`swarmPromptScopes`), what became of a delivery
 * (`teamDelivery`), the account's tab channels (`readChannelDesk`) and their start (`startTeams`).
 *
 * Tab collaboration is now a service (services/collaboration.ts), routed by the socket like any other. This
 * starts it on the socket in its own process, as `HARNESSD_SERVICES=none` does, from the core's API as those
 * specs knew it: the real registry's agents, the turns the socket's `onMessage` writes, and the frames the
 * socket sends its windows. So the specs run as they were written, and say the same of the moved service.
