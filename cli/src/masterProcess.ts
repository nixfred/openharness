/**
 * harnessd's master as a process: what `harness start` runs (`__harnessd`), and the probe a master about
 * to re-execute on a new bundle asks first (`__harnessd-probe`, harnessd/reexec.ts).
 *
 * The master holds no feature code (harnessd/AGENTS.md), yet weighed what the whole CLI weighs: every
 * process evaluated the whole bundle, and Node parses all of the file a process is started on whatever
 * it runs. Measured from the bundle at idle (2026-10-05): the master 160 MiB resident, each service 115
 * to 160. So a master started on cli.js re-executes itself, same pid, on the lean bundle cli.js carries
 * (harnessd/leanBundle.ts), and starts the services and the core from it too: each then parses its own
 * code and not the whole CLI's 4.4 MB.
