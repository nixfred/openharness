// Pushing a firmware image to the dial over the cable it is already talking on.

// The dial has no WiFi, so it cannot fetch its own updates any more. The daemon does it instead: it reads
// the SAME published manifest the device used to poll (`harness/esp32/ota/metadata.json` on GCS), caches
// the image, and offers it over the wire. Nothing about the release pipeline changes — `make
// upload-circle` still publishes, and this only changes WHO downloads.
//
// Deliberately NOT bundled into this CLI's own build. The sibling product does bundle its panel image, and
// it bought a trap with it: "different from mine" is a comparison, not an ordering, so an app build from
// two days earlier silently flashed a freshly-built panel BACK to the older image, twice, before anyone
// noticed. Reading the published manifest makes the newest release the reference for everyone.

   *
   * Measured on hardware 2026-08-24, and it is worth stating exactly because the symptom hid the cause:
   * one slice of a 3,091,648-byte image went out TWICE and the next never went out at all. The dial wrote
   * both, 8192 bytes each, so its byte counter reported a perfect 3091648/3091648 while the image in flash
   * had slice 130 sitting where slice 131 belonged. It failed at esp_ota_end with a checksum error, which
   * reads as a corrupt download rather than as a bug on this side. Reading the slot back and diffing it
   * against the published image is what named it.
   *
   *   · `offset` ADVANCES BEFORE THE AWAIT. Reserving the range first is what makes a concurrent entry
   *     pick up the NEXT slice instead of resending the one already on the wire.
   *   · `pumping` keeps the second caller out entirely. This side has no equivalent of the firmware's
   *     tx lock, so two loops on one port would interleave the halves of two frames. The running loop
   *     re-reads `acked` every iteration, so the credit the second caller brought is not lost by turning
