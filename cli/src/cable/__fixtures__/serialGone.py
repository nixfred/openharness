"""Drive an owned PTY whose far end goes away; never enumerate or open a real device.

`gone`: the slave is held open here (as a daemon still holding its port would), the master closed, and then
the worker opens the slave: it must refuse at once, not wait in open() for a master that is not coming.
`raced`: the same, with the worker's probe read told "nothing yet", as when the master goes just after it:
the port must open without waiting, and close on the far end's end.
`early`: the master writes before the worker opens the slave, and then more: the worker gets both, in order.
