// The message layer: what the daemon and the dial SAY to each other, on top of the bytes serial.ts moves.
//
// Written twice — here and in devices/harness-device/firmware/main/cable_client.c — with no shared code, because one half
// is TypeScript on a laptop and the other is C on an MCU. The framing underneath agrees by shared vectors;
// this layer agrees by docs/cable-protocol.md and by being small enough to read in one sitting.
//
// THE VOCABULARY IS THE PRODUCT'S: machine → agent → session. The machine is this computer, the agents
// are what the registry holds, and a session is one conversation underneath an agent.
//
// Three rules here were paid for on real hardware and are not style:
//
//   1. ANSWER EVERY `hello`, RE-ATTACH ONLY FOR A DIAL NOT ALREADY GREETED. The dial greets on a cadence
//      because it has no port-open event to wait on. Attaching means "this device knows nothing" and
//      pushes the whole state again; doing that on every greeting re-sends everything every 15 seconds.
//
//   2. PING EVEN WHEN IDLE, AND REOPEN THE PORT ON SILENCE. After the dial reboots, macOS hands back a
//      `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` node with the same name, the same inode and the same device numbers. Writes to
//      the old handle keep succeeding, the read never completes, and nothing raises. Without a heartbeat
//      this daemon would talk to a dead file for as long as anyone watched.
//
//   3. SAY NOTHING WHEN NOTHING CHANGED. That is what keeps the link idle during a long turn, and it is
//      why rule 2 has to exist at all.

//
// TWENTY SECONDS, RAISED FROM EIGHT, because eight was under the cost of the thing it was timing.

//
//   22:26:28.077  cannot open the dial: open timed out after 8000ms   ← gave up
//   22:26:29.660  dial 28:84:85:90:5F:78 on fw 0.0.58 proto 3         ← opened, 1.58s late

//   22:26:29.662  closed (abandoned — open timed out)                 ← and thrown away
//
// The open costs about 9.6s there, every time, so the deadline never once let a working link live: the
// cycle repeated on an exact 8-second beat for as long as anyone watched, and the dial sat on "Not
// connected" while the daemon greeted it successfully every eight seconds and hung up on it. That is
// the worst shape a timeout can take — not a slow failure, a discarded success.
