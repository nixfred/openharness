// Everything the cable session needs from the rest of the daemon, in one place.
//
// The session owns the protocol and nothing else; this owns the answers. Keeping them apart is what lets
// the protocol be tested against a fake host — the alternative is a suite that needs tmux, a microphone
// and a network to prove that `hello` gets a `welcome`.
//
// Nothing here is new machinery. The agent list is the registry the web and the backend socket already
// read, the router is the one the backend already calls for remote machines, and the turn events arrive
// as the very `commander_event` cards the WiFi device receives — teed at the socket rather than emitted
// again here, so the two device surfaces cannot drift.
//
// Which machine an agent is on, and every turn, stop and answer sent to it, is the fleet's router
// (services/fleetRouter.ts), shared with ⌘K and the window's voice route. This host asks it through the
// core's port (`wiring.fleet`), never holding it (step D1): a dial in a process of its own asks the same
// port across the service link. It keeps a router of its own for this computer alone, and uses it
// whenever the fleet cannot answer — off, or its call failed — as the dial did before the fleet was a
// service. Its tests give it a bare fleet to route over by itself.
