/**
 * What the apps see, compared with the released build. A daemon of the released build (`COMPAT_FROM`,
 * its bundled `cli.js`) and one of this checkout's bundle run the same scenario: a Claude Code agent
 * and a Codex agent created, a turn each, a question and a permission answered, search, every request
 * the apps send (well formed and malformed), then the lifecycle: rename, cancel, fork, restart, stop,
 * resume, close. Their replies, and the shape of the frames a turn, a question and a permission push,
 * are compared once ids, times, paths and counters are made comparable.
 *
 * A field this build adds is reported and allowed: the apps ignore what they do not read. Any other
 * difference (a field gone, a value changed, an error instead of an answer) is either listed in CHANGED
 * with why it changed on purpose, or a regression. This is the check behind "a release breaks no app":
 * the desktop app, `hn` and the phone were written against the released daemon's answers.
 *
 * Skipped unless COMPAT_FROM names a released bundle, so CI does not build old releases. Before a
 * release: use the current published bundle (0.3.60 or later), or build the last released tag's bundle
 * (`node build-bundle.mjs` in a checkout of it) and run
 * `COMPAT_FROM=<that>/dist/cli.js npm run test:e2e -- compat`. `COMPAT_REPORT=<file>` writes both
 * sides' answers and every difference, for reading one by one.
