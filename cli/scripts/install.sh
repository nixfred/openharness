# harness — one-line installer, served from the CDN at
# https://cdn.autonomous.ai/harness/cli/install.sh (source of truth: THIS file, cli/scripts/install.sh in
# the autonomous-harness repo — published with `make upload-cli-install-sh` from the repo root, and
# checked by cli/src/scripts/install.spec.ts). Not the same thing as cli/scripts/install-cli.sh, which
# installs the CLI from a working tree for local development and publishes nothing.
# The website (autonomous-code, apps/web) still answers the OLD URL, https://harness.autonomous.ai/cli/
# install.sh, but only as a redirect to the CDN one (its next.config.js) — kept for anyone with the old
# link already saved.
#   curl -fsSL https://cdn.autonomous.ai/harness/cli/install.sh | bash               # the CLI and hn
#   curl -fsSL https://cdn.autonomous.ai/harness/cli/install.sh | sh -s -- --desktop  # Desktop: runtime + CLI only
#   curl -fsSL https://cdn.autonomous.ai/harness/cli/install.sh | sh -s -- --host     # Desktop: host requirements only
#   hn                            # Harness in this terminal: starts locally, no login required
#   harness login
#   harness start
#   harness remote-password set   # so your other machines (and `harness remote`) can reach this one
#
# Downloads the self-contained CLI bundle from the public GCS manifest and installs a `harness` command.
# Login and start are deliberately separate: login saves a native SSO session, while start launches the
# adapter from that session. The running daemon auto-updates itself thereafter (polls the same manifest).
# There is no system Node prerequisite. The CLI is plain JS (no native binary, no code-signing) and it runs on a
# checksum-verified Node this installer puts in ~/.harness/runtime — the same runtime Desktop Harness
# manages, shared on purpose so one cli.js is never run by two different Nodes. Your own Node and nvm
# are neither required nor touched.
#
# What the CLI RUNS is a short list — tmux (its only terminal backend), `ps`, and on a Linux desktop
# the clipboard helper for the active display — and step 1 checks exactly that list. Everything else
# here (Homebrew, apt, curl/tar/sed/awk/sha256sum) is only a way of obtaining one of those or of
# downloading a runtime, and is looked at only when the thing it obtains is missing: a Mac with tmux
# never hears about Homebrew, and the download tools are checked only when something is downloaded.
# On a Mac without tmux, Homebrew is used if it is already there; otherwise tmux comes the way Node
# does — a checksum-verified MANAGED build from our manifest into ~/.harness/runtime, no compiler,
# no package manager and no password (see cli/scripts/build-managed-tmux.sh).
# Desktop mode (`--desktop`) trusts the app's own host pre-flight and skips step 1; host mode
# (`--host`) is the app handing step 1 to a real terminal for its password prompts and stops after it.
# The runtime's absolute path is baked into the launcher, so a Finder launch — where PATH is
# launchd's bare /usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin — resolves the CLI exactly like a terminal does.
# POSIX sh (so `| sh` and `| bash` both work).
set -eu

# No argument is the complete standalone/server installer. Desktop owns host pre-flight and passes
# --desktop so this script installs only the managed runtime and CLI instead of asking twice for the
# same package-manager/admin work — or --host for the opposite half.

# 2. Resolve the Node that will run the CLI (and this installer's own JSON parse + sha256 verify in
#    step 3). The CLI runs on the MANAGED runtime under ~/.harness/runtime, not on whatever Node the
#    computer happens to have:
#      1. $HARNESS_NODE_BINARY — Desktop Harness handing over the runtime it just validated.
#      2. ~/.harness/runtime/current-node — the managed runtime, if it is already here.
#      3. otherwise, download it.
#    A Node on PATH is used only as a last resort, on a platform we publish no runtime for.
#
#    Why not prefer the user's own Node: it is the version-drift bug in a different shirt. A CLI
#    driven from the desktop app and from a terminal must be ONE cli.js on ONE Node, and a `node`
#    that PATH resolves is none of stable, shared, or ours — it moves with nvm, it differs between a
#    Finder launch and a Terminal launch, and it can be upgraded out from under a running daemon.
#    Nothing outside ~/.harness is read or changed either way; the user's own Node is left alone.
#
#    Everything in this step must run in plain POSIX sh: there is no Node yet to lean on.
