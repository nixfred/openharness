# Drive a second harness machine in Docker — the one thing a single laptop cannot test.
#
# The desktop app reaches another of your machines through the backend relay
# (`src/lib/remoteRelay.ts`): frames leave the local daemon, cross the cloud, and are handled by the
# daemon on the far side. Every interesting behaviour on that path — creating an agent, moving one
# onto a grid, reading back which grid it landed on — is code that never runs when the app and the
# agent share a computer. This rig gives you the far side.
#
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh build     # bundle THIS tree + build the image
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh up        # start the box
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh login     # SSO (interactive — opens a URL you approve)
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh link      # let this Mac's relay reach the box
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh verify    # what each remote agent is ACTUALLY running on
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh sh        # a shell inside the box
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh down      # stop + remove the container (keeps the session)
#   bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh destroy   # ...and throw the session away
#
# `verify` is the instrument the rig exists for. It prints, per agent, BOTH the environment of the
# live engine process (read from /proc, which is the only thing that decides where inference goes)
# AND what the daemon reports about it. Those two disagreeing is a real class of bug — the daemon can
# be right about a process and still describe it wrongly to the app — so the rig refuses to collapse
# them into one number.
