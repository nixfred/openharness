# harness

**Run the coding-agent CLIs you already use, and drive them from anywhere.**

`harness` watches the agent sessions you start in **tmux** on your own machine and bridges them to a
web UI and, optionally, to a paired hardware device. The agents keep running as your processes, in
your terminal, with your credentials; this is a bridge, not a wrapper.

It works with the popular coding agents — [`src/engines/`](src/engines/) is the current list, one
folder per agent, and yours can join them.

- Every supported agent process under a configured terminal backend shows up as one agent you can talk to from the browser.
- Turns, tool calls, todo lists and sub-agents stream out as they happen.
- The browser channel is end-to-end encrypted (see `src/lib/e2ee/`).
- One self-contained bundle with no Node native dependencies. Node ≥ 20 plus tmux is required.

## Supported platforms

**macOS** and **Linux** (Ubuntu 22.04+ verified, bare metal and containers alike). The published
artifact is one pure-JS bundle run by your own Node, so there is no per-OS build to pick and no
native module to compile — the same `cli.js` runs everywhere.

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Node ≥ 20** | On Ubuntu the distro `nodejs` package is too old (24.04 ships 18.19, 22.04 ships 12.22). Install from [NodeSource](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions) or `nvm install 20`. |
| **tmux** | How agents are discovered. Not preinstalled on Ubuntu Server: `sudo apt install tmux`. |
| **`sqlite3` CLI** | Only for the store-backed engines (`opencode`, `kilo`, `hermes`, `devin`), which keep conversations in SQLite instead of a transcript file. Present by default on macOS, **not** on Ubuntu: `sudo apt install sqlite3`. Every other engine works without it, and the daemon says so at startup if it is missing. |

Windows is not supported.

## Swarm tabs and agent communication

Turn on **Settings → Experimental → Swarm collaboration** to try it; it is **off by default**.
Each tab is a swarm, with membership supplied by its agent panes. Agents keep their engines and contexts,
automatically discover peers in their tab, ask a focused question, and continue with the answer.
Agents consult peers only within their current tab. Cross-swarm requests and
Cmd+Shift+A are deferred. **Cmd+Shift+P → Swarm conversation** opens the shared
questions, replies, and delivery states without starting work. Desktop/web and
mobile show the same shared history.

See the [channel guide](../docs/tab-channels.md) for the account opt-in, ownership,
scope, and verification limits. Run `harness channel --help` for commands. The underlying [team protocol](../docs/agent-teams.md) and advanced
`harness team` CLI remain available; delivery preserves busy sessions, drafts, and dialogs.

## Remote media previews

Harness Desktop can download an agent's image/video and open it on the viewing
computer. The CLI advertises `features.mediaPreview` in `terminal_capabilities`.
The existing encrypted `agent_read_file` RPC accepts a media-only variant:
`{agentId, path, media: true, offset, revision?}`. Replies carry `media`, `filename`,
`totalBytes`, `offset`, `revision`, and `contentBase64`. Chunks are 128 KiB; every
chunk after the first must supply its revision. The maximum file size is 512 MiB.

Absolute paths, home-relative paths and file URLs resolve on the owning machine;
relative paths (including symlink targets) stay inside the agent's working folder.
Media suffixes and file signatures are checked. The original text-reading rules
remain unchanged. Reads are stateless, close their handles after each request,
and reject file changes during transfer. Paths and contents are omitted from frame
logs. This reuses the existing E2EE request/reply types and needs no backend release.

`scripts/smoke-media-peer.ts` is an opt-in fixture for Desktop's A/B smoke test;
it uses temporary identities and loopback sockets, never live machine state.

## Install & run (`harness`)

Install the CLI and run `hn` to work locally. Sign in when you want to connect other machines:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://harness.autonomous.ai/cli/install.sh | bash
```

(The installer is a first-party hosted script. It brings its own Node, downloads the published
bundle and writes the `~/.local/bin/harness` command, and `hn`: Harness in a terminal, which starts
your local daemon the first time you run it. Local use requires no login.)

```bash
harness login         # opens browser SSO and saves this computer's session
harness login --force # stop the daemon and sign in as a different SSO account
harness start         # starts the local adapter; uses a saved SSO session if present
harness start -f      # foreground mode for a supervisor; logs to stdout
harness status     # is it running? shows pid + the chat link
harness stop       # stop the background adapter
harness version    # print the installed version
harness tui        # all of Harness in this terminal — tabs, panes, every machine (see tui/README.md)
harness logout     # stop the adapter and clear this computer's SSO session
```

`login` uses the browser's native loopback SSO flow. Its access token, refresh token, expiry and
backend-resolved machine id are stored atomically with owner-only permissions in
`~/.harness/auth/session.json`; the immutable computer id lives separately at
`~/.harness/computer-id`. Later `harness start` invocations reuse and refresh that session as needed.
`login --force` holds the daemon's spawn lock from the moment it stops the old daemon until the new
session is on disk, so a `harness start` that lands while the browser is open (the desktop app runs
one whenever the daemon is down) waits its turn rather than bringing a daemon up on the account being
replaced. `harness start` beside a running daemon also asks it which machine it serves, and restarts
one that answers for another account instead of reporting it "already running".
Raw daemon logs go to `${ADAPTER_DATA_DIR}/harness.log`.

The log is **capped at 10 MB**: the daemon checks the size every minute and, over the cap, rewrites the
file with the newest half (the oldest lines are dropped, marked by a `[log] trimmed` line at the top).
It's one file, not a rotation — 10 MB is the total on disk. A log left under a pre-rename name
(`machine.log`, or the older `adapter.log`) is adopted by rename on the first start, so existing history
carries over.

The daemon **auto-updates itself** — it polls the release manifest once a minute, at second :45 of
each minute (`ADAPTER_UPDATE_SLOT_SEC`), and, on a newer build, downloads + verifies + swaps its own
bundle and restarts at once (with rollback on a bad build). The slot is deliberate: the desktop app
spawns `harness start` only around :15, so an update handoff and a spawn never contend for the daemon's
spawn lock. `harness start` itself stages the newest build only for a daemon it is about to spawn —
with one already running it says so and touches nothing, leaving the update to that daemon. A `401`
on the backend link refreshes the SSO token and reconnects; only a refresh token the backend rejects
signs the computer out. See [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md) for publishing and the update internals.
Disable with `ADAPTER_UPDATE_DISABLE=true`.

**From source (dev):** `cd this package && npm install && npm run build && node dist/cli.js login`
(or `npm run dev -- login` via tsx — always foreground; self-update is off in dev). `npm run bundle`
produces the single-file release artifact.

**Install your build as `harness` (no release):** `bash scripts/install-cli.sh` bundles this
working tree into `~/.harness/cli` — the same layout the public installer produces — and restarts the
daemon on it, so `harness` on this computer means your code without publishing a version. Self-update is
turned **off** in the command shim it writes (otherwise the published release overwrites your build within
the minute). See [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md#local-install-no-upload).

After signing in, start each agent yourself in tmux with its normal vendor command. Harness observes
the process; it does not launch the CLI or choose its permission/trust flags:

```bash
tmux new
claude                    # or: codex, agent, opencode, pi, hermes, cmd, devin, muse, amp, kilo, grok
```

tmux is watched by default — there is no env var to set.

Each supported top-level CLI process appears automatically. Exiting or deleting the agent stops only
the validated engine process; Harness never closes the user-owned tmux pane.

## How it works

```
claude under a terminal backend ──writes──▶ ~/.claude/projects/**.jsonl
        ▲                                   │ chokidar + byte-offset tail (only new lines)
        │ backend input contract            ▼ normalize → ServerEvents (+ derived turn lifecycle)
   adapter CLI ◀────── down:{agentId} ── backend /api/adapter-ws ── up:{agentId} ──▶ web chat
```

- **The adapter emulates a node** on the backend hub: it answers the hosted runtime RPCs
  (`agents_list` = discovered engine processes, `sessions_list`, `session_get` = full JSONL
  replay, `project_files`/`project_read_file` = the session's cwd file tree + file view,
  `models_list`, `claude_login_status`) and consumes web chat frames.
- **Files panel** (`project_files`/`project_read_file`): rooted at the tmux session's working dir,
  it lists the tree (ignoring `node_modules`/`.git`/`dist`/… like the hosted runtime) and views a file only
  if it's **≤ 5 MB and text** (binary → rejected). The same guard was added to the hosted runtime so
  both behave identically.
- **Process discovery is lifetime authority.** On startup and every five seconds the daemon reads each
  configured terminal inventory and one shared process table. A supported top-level engine creates an agent immediately,
  before an engine session exists. A changed process in the same pane replaces it immediately; an absent
  process is removed after two successful scans. Probe failures do not remove anything.
- **Only sessions the daemon created are discoverable.** The tmux inventory is limited to sessions
  named `harness-<engine>-<timestamp>`, which is what `agent_create` names them. A tmux session you
  open by hand and run an engine in, or one an agent spawns itself with a nested `tmux new-session`,
  never becomes an agent — create it through the app (or `agent_create`) instead.
- **Agents survive a reboot.** The registry outlives the tmux server. On start, every registered agent
  whose pane is gone (a reboot, a `tmux kill-server`) gets a new pane running the same engine in the
  same folder, resuming its engine session when it has one, under the same agent id — so the app's
  tiles reattach by themselves. An agent that was pointed at a grid comes back on that grid: the
  registry row keeps the launch it was created or retargeted with (`gridLaunch`, key included, in the
  0600 `registry.json`), and restore, `agent_restart` and the offline hook fallback all reuse it — a
  relaunch on the engine's own login would spend the wrong account while looking identical. A Codex
  profile agent comes back under its `CODEX_HOME` with its hooks installed. A grid row written before
  the launch was persisted is not relaunched; it is marked `GRID_CREDENTIAL_REQUIRED` instead. An
  engine with no resume flag (devin) comes back fresh.
- **Hooks bind mutable engine sessions** to the process agent using authenticated tmux
  runtime hints plus verified caller ancestry. They do not
  require `MACHINE_ID`. `SessionStart` and catch hooks attach transcript/store metadata; `SessionEnd` only
  requests an immediate process reconciliation. `/clear`, `/new`, and resume move or rotate the binding
  without changing the live process agent's UUID.
- **Live agent sync** to web + device: discovery emits `agent_synced` immediately, even with no session;
  binding later emits session sync, and confirmed process exit emits one `agent_deleted`. A sessionless
  agent returns an empty `sessions_list`, accepts input by `agentId`, and binds after the first turn.
- **A new agent can be pointed at a grid.** When the desktop app has a grid selected it sends
  `payload.grid` (relay base URL, a key minted for that launch, and optionally a model) on
  `agent_create`; the daemon turns it into the engine's own environment and gives the new tmux
  session that environment with `new-session -e`, so the credential never appears in the engine's
  argv. Six engines have a documented way to be pointed somewhere else and are supported through it:
  **claude** (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`), **codex** (`-c model_providers.grid.*`, key via `env_key`),
  **hermes** (`OPENAI_BASE_URL`), **grok** (`GROK_MODELS_BASE_URL`), **copilot**
  (`COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL`), and two that need a provider DECLARED rather than an endpoint moved:
  **pi** (a private config directory via `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`) and **opencode** (a private
  `opencode.json` via `OPENCODE_CONFIG`) — so the user's own `~/.pi` and `~/.config/opencode` are
  never touched. OpenCode is in that second group because pointing `OPENAI_BASE_URL` at a grid leaves
  its compiled-in model catalogue in charge: the endpoint moves, the model names do not, and the
  relay answers `503 · No providers available for this model`.
  Every other engine is **refused** with `GRID_ENGINE_UNSUPPORTED`
  and a reason specific to it — some talk only to their own service, some need a provider block
  written into a dotfile this daemon will not edit — rather than quietly started on its own login.
  Needs tmux ≥ 3.2; an older one is refused as `TMUX_TOO_OLD_FOR_GRID`. See `src/lib/gridLaunch.ts`.
- **A running agent can be moved to a grid** (`agent_retarget`): `respawn-pane -k -e` re-execs the
  pane's engine with the new launch and `--resume`, keeping the pane, its id and its scrollback, and
  the new process is adopted onto the same agent record. A pane mid-turn is refused (`AGENT_BUSY`)
  rather than interrupted. Which grid an agent is on is read off its live process
  (`src/lib/gridAssignment.ts`), never bookkept.
- **Mirror-all**: every JSONL line streams up — prompts typed directly in the terminal render in
  the web identically to web-sent ones (`turn_started`/`turn_ended` are derived from the file).
- **Compaction (`/compact` or auto-compact):** claude does an **in-file** compact — the JSONL keeps
  the **same sessionId** and stays **append-only** (pre-compact history is preserved on disk), so the
  byte-offset tail streams straight through with no dead file and no truncation re-read. The injected
  `system`/`compact_boundary` line becomes a single `context_compact` UI hint; the big
  `isCompactSummary` summary line and any `isMeta` bookkeeping line are **suppressed via those
  authoritative flags** (`compactEventFromRaw` in `lib/normalize.ts`) so the summary is never rendered
  as a fake user turn — an auto-compact firing mid-turn keeps the open turn open.
- A web chat message arrives as a `message` frame and is submitted through one validated primary runtime.

### Terminal backend behavior

- **tmux is the only supported backend.** The retired Herdr backend has been removed.
  `TERMINAL_BACKENDS=herdr` is not an error — it is dropped with a warning and the daemon runs on tmux,
  because the CLI self-updates and a retired setting must not stop an unattended machine from starting.
  `HERDR_SESSIONS` and `HERDR_BIN` are no longer read.
- **Unset means auto**, which resolves to tmux alone. `TERMINAL_BACKENDS` survives only as a pin.
- Harness never auto-starts a session.
- `harness status` answers "is my pane being watched?" — `terminalSelection` says `auto` or `configured`,
  and `terminalTargets` lists what is live right now, not what was configured at boot.
- The shared backend contract can create and close a tmux session when explicitly
  invoked. This is lifecycle capability, not automatic startup behavior; normal discovery observes
  user-owned sessions, and agent deletion still terminates only the validated engine process.
- One process visible through nested panes remains one Harness agent with multiple runtime locators;
  an engine process replacement does not.
- Backend failures are independent. A failed probe is `unknown`, not proof of death. An
  agent with no verified runtime becomes dormant and is republished with the same id after recovery.
- Existing `tmuxPane` registry rows migrate in place. tmux rows retain their legacy projection during
  the compatibility window. Runtimes an earlier build recorded for a Herdr pane are dropped on load, and
  an agent that lived only in one is removed.

For reproducible multiplexer verification, install dependencies and run the opt-in real suite from
`cli/` under a normal umask:

```bash
umask 022
npm ci
npm run test:tmux-real
```

The suite uses isolated, test-owned lifecycle fixtures. Its engine matrix explicitly skips commands that are not installed; authentication or
first-run onboarding that prevents a proprietary CLI from running is unavailable evidence and must be
reported as such, not described as exercised.

## Config (`.env`, see `.env.example`)

| var | default | meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `BACKEND_WS_URL` | `wss://harness-api.autonomous.ai` | backend to dial (`/api/adapter-ws`) |
| `AUTONOMOUS_ENV` | `prod` | SSO environment: `prod` or `stag` |
| `ADAPTER_COMPUTER_ID` | *(unset)* | pin the stable local computer id for an ephemeral host; never written to disk |
| `PORT` | `18473` | localhost port for the hook callbacks (FIXED — if taken, the adapter reports it rather than picking a random port) |
| `CLAUDE_PROJECTS_DIR` | `~/.claude/projects` | where Claude writes session JSONL |
| `ADAPTER_DATA_DIR` | `~/.harness/cli/data` | registry and daemon-local state (SSO session is always `~/.harness/auth/session.json`) |
| `DISABLE_HOOK_INSTALL` | `false` | skip auto-installing the claude hooks |
| `TERMINAL_BACKENDS` | *(auto)* | pin the set. `tmux` is the only supported value; a retired `herdr` is dropped with a warning |
| `TERMINAL_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | backend-neutral discovery interval; minimum 5000 ms |
| `TMUX_REAP_INTERVAL_MS` | `5000` | process discovery interval (removal requires two confirmed misses) |
| `ADAPTER_UPDATE_URL` | `…/adapter/metadata.json` | GCS release manifest the daemon polls for a newer build |
| `ADAPTER_UPDATE_KEY` | `cli` | manifest key for this CLI |
| `ADAPTER_UPDATE_CHECK_MS` | `60000` | how often (ms) to poll for a newer build (no check on start — `harness start` already staged the newest) |
| `ADAPTER_UPDATE_SLOT_SEC` | `45` | the wall-clock second each poll lands on; keeps clear of the desktop's `harness start` slot at :15. Negative = plain interval |
| `ADAPTER_UPDATE_DISABLE` | `false` | set `true` to turn self-update off |
| `ADAPTER_CLI_DIR` | `~/.harness/cli` | install dir holding the `cli.js`/`notify.mjs` the updater swaps |
| `LOG_FRAMES` | `false` | one log line per backend frame — type, audience and opaque ids, never a payload body. Every content-bearing frame is encrypted before it reaches the socket, so this is the only way to see what the daemon actually sent |
| `HARNESS_HOOK_DEADLINE_MS` | `4500` | wall-clock budget a hook gives itself before abandoning optional work. Raise it on a slow or heavily loaded machine, where the budget is spent on load rather than on the hook and the offline registry fallback silently does nothing. Clamped, never below the default |
| `SUMMARY_MODE` | `local` | who writes the recap HEADLINE. `local`: no model — the answer's first sentence is excerpted, instantly; the dial shows what the terminal shows. `model`: a one-shot of the session's own engine, fed the previous recap, the user's ask and the answer — reads better across turns, at ~9s of latency per turn. The `text` under the headline is the answer's own excerpt in both modes |
| `ORI_SUMMARY_MODEL` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | recap model for agents routed through an OpenRouter gateway (`ori claude`), which have no vendor credential to spend |
| `ORI_VOICE_ROUTE_MODEL` | `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` | same, for the voice router's classification |
| `ORI_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | `~/.ori/credentials.json` | where `ori login` stores its key; read only when neither the daemon env nor the agent's own process supplies one |

## Device (hardware commander)

A paired device mirrors the same agent. The adapter emits a curated **commander stream** from the
same watched JSONL (via `sendCommander`, `commanderEligible`): `commander_event` cards —
`processing` (busy), `tool` (name + arg + color), `todos` checklist, `summary`, `done` (clear busy).
It answers the device's `agents_list` (tiles) and `agent_recent` (last summary) RPCs; voice
turns arrive as an injected `message` → `sendToTmux`. A device that joins **mid-turn** converges via
a client-count signal (`__clients`) — the adapter re-emits the open turn's live state on join (no
periodic heartbeat).

The per-turn **summary/recap** matches the hosted runtime: on turn end, *only while a device is
connected*, the adapter runs a disposable one-shot from the session's own CLI engine
(`SUMMARY_MODEL`, `CODEX_SUMMARY_MODEL`, or `CURSOR_SUMMARY_MODEL`) → a one-line `recap ≤15 words`,
shows a `Summarizing…` indicator while it runs, persists `recap\n\ntext` per session
(`${ADAPTER_DATA_DIR}/summaries.json`), and returns it on `project_recent` at device boot. A newer
turn aborts a stale recap. The `text` under the headline is NOT model-written: it is the answer
itself, flattened to one line and clipped to 250 characters (`deriveTurnBody`) — the dial shows only
the headline, the device protocol defines `text` as an excerpt, and a paraphrase nobody reads cost
output tokens on every turn.

The one-shot is `recap = llm(instruct, previous recap, the user's ask, the answer)`. The previous
recap is the session's last stored summary, quoted as *continuity only* — it lets a turn whose
answer is "done, same change in the other file" recap as what was done instead of a fragment — and
the prompt forbids repeating it or reporting it as this turn's news. `SUMMARY_MODE=local` drops the
model: the answer's first prose sentence becomes the headline in the same tick (no `Summarizing…`),
which is the right trade when the dial sits next to a window already showing the full text.

## Pair an Autonomous device directly

Harness discovers the OS's existing `_autonomous._tcp` advertisement. Select a discovered device
and enter the code displayed on it; no IP address or device backend login is needed.

```sh
harness autonomous-device discover --json
harness autonomous-device pair --device '<discovery-id>' --code-stdin
harness autonomous-device status --json
harness autonomous-device list --json
harness autonomous-device revoke '<full fingerprint from list>'
```

Desktop writes the code to stdin and closes stdin. Terminal users may use
`pair <device-code> --device <discovery-id>`. Mac connects directly to the advertised OS endpoint,
reusing the original Harness E2eeManager and identity store. Saved associations rediscover/reconnect
automatically. Revoke closes only the selected device connection. Existing Harness Mac login/start
requirements remain unchanged; the running daemon's direct device transport works offline from
its backend. Browser/dial behavior and Buddy are unchanged.

See [the contract](../docs/autonomous-device-integration.md).
