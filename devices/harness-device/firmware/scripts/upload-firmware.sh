# Full device firmware release: bump version -> build -> upload to a PUBLIC GCS bucket.
# Devices fetch the manifest + binary straight from GCS (no backend involved — see main/ota.c /
# DEVICE_OTA_METADATA_URL) and self-update on their next boot / ~6h check. See RELEASE.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/upload-firmware.sh              # auto-bump (0.1.2 -> 0.1.3; 0.1.99 -> 0.2.1)
#   bash scripts/upload-firmware.sh 0.2.0        # release an explicit version
#   bash scripts/upload-firmware.sh --no-bump    # keep version.txt as-is, build + upload
#   bash scripts/upload-firmware.sh --no-build   # skip the build, upload the existing build/ artifact
#   bash scripts/upload-firmware.sh --no-commit  # deprecated no-op (version is no longer git-tracked)
#   GCS_BUCKET=other-bucket bash scripts/upload-firmware.sh   # env overrides (see below)
#
# The CURRENT version is read from the remote metadata.json on GCS (single source of truth) and the
# patch is bumped from there — the local version.txt is NOT committed/pushed (only written so the
# build can stamp the firmware). Steps: (1) resolve+bump version, (2) idf.py build, (3) upload .bin +
# merge metadata.json to GCS.
# Prereqs: `gcloud storage` authenticated (gcloud auth) with WRITE access to the bucket; the bucket/objects
# must be public-read so devices can download without credentials. `idf.py` on PATH (or IDF_PATH set).

# WHICH SILICON THIS RELEASE IS FOR, NAMED OUT LOUD.
#
# One project builds for two boards now, and this script builds into its own fresh directory — so
# nothing in it says which. ESP-IDF then GUESSES, and what it guesses from is a stale `sdkconfig`
# left in the firmware directory by whoever built last. On this desk that happened to say esp32s3
# and the release looked fine; on a clean checkout, where no such file exists, IDF falls back to
# plain `esp32` and the build dies at CMake (verified, 2026-09-28).
#
# Loud rather than silent, so this was never going to ship the wrong image — but it was going to
# stop working the first time it ran anywhere but here, which for a release script is the same
# problem one step later. The pair moves together: OTA_KEY names the manifest entry, and this names
# the chip whose image goes in it.
IDF_TARGET_BOARD="${IDF_TARGET_BOARD:-esp32s3}"

# THE VERSION STAYS A PLAIN NUMBER, and that is load-bearing.
#
# fwPush.ts only offers a version matching ^v?\d+\.\d+\.\d+$, and fw_update.c compares the offered
# string to the image's own esp_app_desc.version. A suffix — `0.0.94-habitat` was one, left in a build
# directory's CMake cache and shipped to a device on 2026-09-29 — is therefore neither offered nor
# installed, and the device holding it can never be updated over the cable again.
