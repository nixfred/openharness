// The board this image is running on — decided at boot, not at build.
//
// Two dials ship at once. Same panel, audio, pins and firmware; they differ only in the touch
// controller, the reset pins and whether there is a PMIC (docs/plans/2026-09-15-004-two-boards-plan.md):
//
//                        touch              lcd/touch reset   PMIC (AXP2101 @0x34)   sleep key
//   "cst9217+axp2101"    CST9217 @0x5A      GPIO39 / GPIO40   yes: battery, PWR key   PWR tap, BOOT hold
//   "cst816s"            CST816S @0x15      GPIO1  / GPIO2    no                      BOOT hold
//
// Every one of those is a fact the I2C bus answers, so one image asks and configures itself — no SKU
// burned at the factory, no second OTA manifest, no image that can be flashed onto the wrong dial.
// Read per FEATURE, not per SKU: a batch that mixes them (CST816S with a PMIC, say) is right too.
