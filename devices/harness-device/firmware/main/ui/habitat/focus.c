/*
 * THE FOCUS FACE — the agent screen, laid out like the octopus's (owner, 2026-10-01).
 *
 * The session's name curves along the top edge in the octopus's own arc, in Geist Medium 26 laid out
 * glyph by glyph along it (ht_arc_title_face, ht_arc_geist_prop);
 * the engine's mark stands where the octopus does, 56 px (focus_marks.c) — for an engine with a pet
 * (Claude, Codex: pets.c) it is the animated pet instead, centred in the same box. Under it the recap
 * in a fixed card that always has room for four lines of geist_med_30 (focus_faces.c), 1 px apart — as
 * many as the octopus reads — a shorter recap centred in it; the card and the mark never move with its
 * length (owner, 2026-10-02). With no card, the working line or a resting line ("Let's build it", …)
 * is centred on the glass. The mark stands
 * halfway between the name and what is under it — the card's top, or the line. There is no tab pill and no microphone: a tap anywhere
 * on the face talks to the agent, a hold opens the tabs, a tap on the name opens the panes
 * (ui_habitat.c).
 *
 * The fonts are the LVGL firmware's (assets/lvgl/SPEC.md), laid out by ht_lv_label — LVGL's own wrap,
 * centring and LONG_DOT.
 *
 * ── the rule that decides the SHAPE of this file ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ht_damage() diffs run index against run index and repaints the whole 466x466 the moment the count
 * or the order changes (terminal.c). So the home face emits the SAME ELEVEN RUNS IN THE SAME ORDER on
 * every frame — name, mark, card, recap ×4, status, resting line ×2, lower-arc status — each empty
 * where it has nothing to say. Do not make one conditional. The lower arc is a working scene's
 * status line (arc_status below); every other state, and every other engine, leaves it empty. A scene's
 * overlay (Codex's sandbox bubble) takes the first recap line's slot, which a working scene (no recap)
 * leaves empty, and is emitted after the scene's own run so it draws over it.
