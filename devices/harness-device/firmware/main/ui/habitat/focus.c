/*
 * THE FOCUS FACE — the agent screen, laid out like the octopus's (owner, 2026-10-01).
 *
 * The session's name curves along the top edge in the octopus's own arc, in Inter Medium 26 laid out
 * glyph by glyph along it (ht_arc_title_face, ht_arc_inter_prop; the lower-arc status and the Listening
 * sweep wear the same face on the lower curve, ht_arc_inter_lower);
 * the engine's mark stands where the octopus does, 56 px (focus_marks.c) — for an engine with a pet
 * (Claude, Codex: pets.c) it is the animated pet instead, centred in the same box. Under it the recap
 * is set in the "Kindle dark" layout (owner, 2026-10-02, K3: mockup/kindle_options.py), now in Inter, SF Compact's
 * open look-alike (owner, 2026-10-03): no card,
 * soft white Inter 30 (inter_30, focus_faces.c) on the black ground, each line centred
 * on x 233 in a 364 px column at x 51, 43 px apart, up to four lines — as many as the octopus reads — and a longer recap
 * ends in "…". The block is centred vertically in a fixed area (y 176..376), so the mark never moves
 * with its length. A question takes the recap's place and look. With no recap, the working line or a
 * resting line ("Let's build it", …) is centred on the glass. The mark stands halfway between the
 * name and what is under it — the recap area's top, or the line. There is no tab pill and no microphone: a tap anywhere
 * on the face talks to the agent, a hold opens the tabs, a tap on the name opens the panes
 * (ui_habitat.c).
 *
 * Every word is Inter (focus_faces.c, owner 2026-10-02: one font), laid out by ht_lv_label — LVGL's own wrap,
 * centring and LONG_DOT.
 *
 * ── the rule that decides the SHAPE of this file ────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * ht_damage() diffs run index against run index and repaints the whole 466x466 the moment the count
 * or the order changes (terminal.c). So the home face emits the SAME ELEVEN RUNS IN THE SAME ORDER on
 * every frame — name, mark, card (an invisible placeholder since the "Kindle dark" recap, kept so the count and
 * order never move), recap ×4, status, resting line ×2, lower-arc status — each empty
 * where it has nothing to say. Do not make one conditional. The lower arc is a working scene's
 * status line (arc_status below); every other state, and every other engine, leaves it empty. A scene's
 * overlay (Codex's sandbox bubble) takes the first recap line's slot, which a working scene (no recap)
 * leaves empty, and is emitted after the scene's own run so it draws over it.

 * THE VOICE SCREEN: the waveform, or the three sparkles, and nothing else.

 * The device drew it this way before habitat — a green meter on black while it listens, then three
 * marks while the words are on their way — and there is nothing else worth saying on a screen whose
 * whole job is to show that it is hearing you. So this branch emits the face's eight runs with the
 * other six empty, which is what keeps ht_damage() on its cheap path; see the note at the top.
 *
 * Nine bars from six heights, indexed by the 0..4 level that already reaches every skin through
 * pose.level. The shape is a hill: loud makes it taller, not wider.
 */
/*
 * THE RECORDING METER, as the old firmware drew it.
 *
 * Seven bars, six pixels wide, on a 22.4 px pitch about the screen's middle, resting at heights
 * 16/52/79/121/79/52/16 — the Figma measurements the deleted ui_screens.c carried — with a crest
 * travelling left to right. There it was seven LVGL rectangles whose heights an animation timer
 * drove every 40 ms; here each bar is one run of ht_wave, whose cell IS one bar in sixteen heights,
 * so the same picture costs seven runs and no allocation.
 *
 * The travelling wave is a table rather than a sine at runtime. The old tick advanced a phase 12°
 * every 40 ms and offset each bar by 40°, scaling its rest height between 0.35x and 1.0x; that is a
 * closed form over fifteen frames and seven bars, so it is evaluated once, by
 * scripts/gen_habitat_fonts.py's sibling arithmetic, and lives here as 105 bytes of level indices.
 * No trigonometry, no floating point, and the cycle is the old 1.2 s exactly — see
 * ht_focus_motion_tick for why fifteen frames at this duration land there.
