 * A large scene a pet can play in place of its small self (Claude, Codex): `loop` indexes `frames` (cell
 * sprites, w x h px), one step per step_ms. The working and sending scenes' loop is [step]; the listening
 * scene's is [level 0..HT_PET_SCENE_LEVELS - 1][step].
 *
 * A scene may carry an OVERLAY (Codex: the sandbox bubble, the equalizer bubble, the paper plane): a second,
 * small sprite drawn after the scene's own, its `loop` and `at` indexed exactly like the scene's loop (level *
 * steps + step), `at` = where its frame sits, x then y in px from the scene's top-left. An overlay frame is
 * transparent where it leaves the scene as drawn, and a 1 x 1 transparent one stands for "nothing now".
 * `dx`, `dy` move the scene from the home position focus.c centres it at (0 for Claude's, which is
 * centred); the Codex art is placed as the mockup's canvas places it.
