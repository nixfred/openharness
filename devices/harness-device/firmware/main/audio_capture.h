// Record at 16 kHz — the rate the STT models are actually trained on. 8 kHz is the telephony fallback,
// and this used to be set to it: halving the byte rate mattered when audio left over the device's flaky
// WiFi and uploads were throughput-limited.
//
// There is no WiFi on this firmware. Audio goes out over the USB cable, measured at ~238 KB/s while
// pushing a firmware image (3,091,648 B in 13 s, 2026-08-24). 16 kHz mono 16-bit produces 32 KB/s, so the
// link carries it with 7x to spare — the constraint that justified spending accuracy on bandwidth is gone
// with the radio.
//
// ONE constant, TWO devices: the done-beep is synthesised against this same rate (audio_capture.c), so mic
// and speaker stay in step by construction. Changing it here changes both, coherently.
//
// The rate travels with the audio rather than being assumed: `voice.begin` carries it as `sr`, the daemon
// forwards the DIAL's number instead of guessing, and the backend writes it into the WAV header.
