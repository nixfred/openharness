// The message layer: what the dial and the harness daemon SAY to each other, on top of the bytes
// cable_link moves. Normative description in docs/specs/cable-protocol.md — that document is written
// twice, here and in cli/src/cable/cableSession.ts of the autonomous-harness repository, with no shared
// code, so it is the only place the two halves agree by construction rather than by coincidence.
//
// Two things this layer owns and nothing else does:
//
//   THE HANDSHAKE. The dial says `hello`, the daemon answers `welcome`, the dial asks for `agents.list`.
//   Until `welcome` lands there is no session and the screen says "Not connected".
//
//   BEING LENIENT. Everything arriving here came off a cable that carries bootloader chatter at every
//   boot and may be talking to a daemon newer than this firmware. A message that cannot be read is
//   discarded and COUNTED — never a reason to drop the link, and never a reason to reboot.
//
// THE VOCABULARY IS OURS: machine → agent → session. One machine (the computer on the other end of the
// cable), N agents inside it (each with its own workspace and engine), and a session is one conversation
// underneath an agent. The sibling firmware this protocol's framing came from calls a tile a "chat" and
// a workspace a "project"; those are its product's words, not ours, and copying them here is how a rename
// that already cost this repository twice starts again.
