//
//   BOOT ─▶ display ─▶ UI ─▶ USB cable link ─▶ the daemon's agent list ─▶ tileview
//
// There is ONE way in, and it is the cable. This firmware has no WiFi, no backend socket, no credential
// and nothing to pair: plugging the dial into a computer running the harness daemon IS the authorization,
// and everything the screen shows arrives over that wire.
//
// What that deleted, and why the boot is a dozen lines instead of a state machine: the SoftAP setup
// portal, the saved-networks walk, the cool-standby retry loop, SNTP, the REST pairing calls, the E2EE
// identity, the OTA download mode and the WS reconnect ladder all existed to get a device onto a network
// and prove who it was. A cable answers both questions by existing.
