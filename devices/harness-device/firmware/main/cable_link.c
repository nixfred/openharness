// Driver FIFOs.
//
// ⚠️ RX IS NOT A CONVENIENCE — IT IS THE ONLY THING BETWEEN A SLOW READER AND SILENT DATA LOSS. There is
// no back-pressure on this peripheral. The IDF driver's ISR (esp_driver_usb_serial_jtag/src/
// usb_serial_jtag.c) does:
//
//     rx_fifo_len = usb_serial_jtag_ll_read_rxfifo(buf, USB_SER_JTAG_RX_MAX_SIZE);
//     xRingbufferSendFromISR(rx_ring_buf, buf, rx_fifo_len, &xTaskWoken);
//
// It drains the hardware FIFO unconditionally and ignores the ringbuffer's return value, so a full ring
// means those bytes are simply gone — and because emptying the HW FIFO is what lets the peripheral ACK
// the next OUT packet, the host is never NAK'd and never learns anything went missing. Not reading fast
// enough does not slow the sender down; it shreds the stream.
//
// Measured on this hardware by the sibling firmware, not theorised: with a smaller ring a firmware
// transfer died at 0 of 1,342,160 bytes written. Each 8 KB slice takes ~16 ms to reach flash, and at USB
// full speed ~16 KB arrives while the reader task is inside that write.
//
// So the rule this file keeps: RX_BUF ≥ the largest number of bytes the peer may have in flight while
// this task is blocked. The firmware transfer is the only sender that can saturate the link, and its
// credit window is 16 KB (docs/specs/cable-protocol.md, "Firmware update"). 32 KB is that window twice
// over, for scheduling jitter. Changing either number without the other reintroduces exactly this bug.
#define USJ_RX_BUF (32 * 1024)

// TX is sized so the largest thing this link really sends — a PCM chunk plus framing — fits in one go and
// the write does not block halfway through a frame waiting for the host to drain. (CABLE_MAX_PAYLOAD is
// 8192, but that is a bound on damage from a corrupt length field, not a size anything actually sends.)
#define USJ_TX_BUF 2048

// One read's worth of bytes off the port. Small on purpose: the decoder is where reassembly happens, so
// this only has to keep the syscall rate sane, and every byte of it is internal RAM.
#define READ_CHUNK 256

// How long a read parks waiting for bytes. Not a poll interval — the driver wakes the task as soon as
// anything arrives. It only bounds how long the task sleeps with nothing to do.
#define READ_WAIT_MS 100

// A stopped host can leave a legal-length header followed by only half its
// payload. Magic inside the next welcome cannot escape that pending payload.
// Expire only an idle gap, not the total duration of a slowly fragmented frame.
#define FRAME_IDLE_US INT64_C(15000000)

// How long a write waits for the host to make room. Finite, and that is the point: an unplugged cable or
// an unopened port fills the TX FIFO and never drains it, and portMAX_DELAY there parks whatever task
// called send() forever. This device is unplugged or in front of a machine with no daemon most of the
// time, so "nobody is reading" has to be an ordinary, survivable answer.
#define WRITE_WAIT_MS 100

// A log line waits far less than a real message. Logging must never become back-pressure on the firmware:
// ESP_LOG is called from every task in the system, and at WRITE_WAIT_MS an unread port would stall each
// of them for a tenth of a second per line. A dropped log line costs a line; a stalled LVGL task costs
// the screen.
#define LOG_WRITE_WAIT_MS 5

// Reader task stack. The frame callback runs on this task, so it carries whatever the message layer
// eventually does — JSON parsing, LVGL updates, and during a firmware install esp_ota_write() plus a
// SHA-256 over the image read back out of flash.
//
// 6 KiB. NOT a measured number yet: ram_telemetry_periodic() reports this task's high-water mark by name
// ("cable_link"), and that is the figure to tune from. The failure this margin is against is real — the
// OTA path on this board's own earlier firmware overflowed an 8 KiB stack and shipped devices that could
// not update themselves.
#define READER_STACK 6144

// One log line's worth of formatted text. Anything longer is truncated rather than split: a log line is
// diagnostic, and half of one that arrives is worth more than a mechanism that could deadlock producing
// the other half.
