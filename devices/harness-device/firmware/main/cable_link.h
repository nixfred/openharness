// The USB transport under cable_frame: bytes in from the native USB port, frames out to it.
//
// This is the whole of the device's connection to the outside world. There is no WiFi on this firmware
// and there is not going to be — plugging the cable in is the authorization, and dropping the network
// takes provisioning, pairing, a backend socket, E2EE and a reconnect ladder out of the design with it.
// So everything the dial ever says goes through the two functions below.
//
// ── ONE PORT, AND WHAT THAT COSTS ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Measured on the board on 2026-08-24: it enumerates as exactly one device —
//
//     303a:1001   "USB JTAG/serial debug unit", Espressif   ← the SoC's own USB peripheral
//
// and nothing else. There is no second UART bridge to move the console to, so the console and this
// protocol share a wire. That is why cable_frame carries a LOG type: while a session is up, every
// ESP_LOG line goes out as a CABLE_TYPE_LOG frame and the daemon files it, so the wire carries frames
// and not a mixture of frames and text.
//
// What CANNOT be framed is the residue, and it is by design: the ROM, the second-stage bootloader and
// the panic handler all write to this port directly, before or instead of anything this file controls.
// The far end's decoder is built to walk through it — that is what the magic scan and the CRC are for.
//
// ── WHEN NOBODY IS LISTENING, THE CONSOLE IS A CONSOLE ──────────────────────────────────────────────
// Log framing is installed when a session starts and removed when it ends (cable_link_set_log_framing).
// Unplugged, or plugged into a machine with no daemon running, the port carries ordinary console text
// and `idf.py monitor` behaves exactly as it always has. Framing logs unconditionally would cost the
// only debugging instrument this board has, in exactly the situation where it is needed most.

// the dial sits unplugged or in front of a machine with no daemon for most of its life. Callers should
// treat it as "not connected", never retry in a tight loop.
