.PHONY: validate merge-pr desktop-test cli-test install-cli upload-cli-install-sh release-cli release-backend release-desktop release-web remote-machine upload-circle device-test

## validate: bounded independent checks with logs and a source/timing receipt.
## See docs/validation-and-release.md. ARGS="path/to/plan.json".
validate:
	python3 scripts/validate-change.py $(ARGS)

## merge-pr: wait for required CI and verify an already-reviewed PR; add --merge to squash it.
## See docs/validation-and-release.md for reviewed source arguments and non-CI checks.
merge-pr:
	python3 scripts/merge-validated-pr.py $(ARGS)

## desktop-test: bounded VM tests, host-sized workers and recorded startup recovery.
## ARGS="test/affected_test.dart --workers 2"; omit paths for the full VM suite.
desktop-test:
	python3 scripts/test-desktop.py $(ARGS)

## cli-test: typecheck + run the CLI test suite.
cli-test:
	cd cli && npx tsc --noEmit && npx vitest run

## release-cli: tag this commit vX.Y.Z_cli and push the tag — CI bundles the CLI, publishes it to
## GCS, and cuts the GitHub Release. The version is bumped from max(last git tag, live
## metadata.json's `cli` key). The `_cli` suffix is a tag-trigger marker only (see cli/RELEASE.md);
## it never appears in the published version. ARGS="--dry-run" to preview.
release-cli:
	bash cli/scripts/release-cli.sh $(ARGS)

## release-backend: tag this commit vX.Y.Z_backend and push the tag — CI builds the backend's Docker
## image and rolls it out. ARGS=minor|major|X.Y.Z to bump differently, ARGS=--dry-run to preview.
## See backend/scripts/release-be.sh.
release-backend:
	bash backend/scripts/release-be.sh $(ARGS)

## release-desktop: tag this commit vX.Y.Z_desktop and push the tag — CI builds both macOS builds
## and both Linux architectures, publishes to GCS, and cuts the GitHub Release. The version is bumped
## from max(last git tag, live harness/desktop/metadata.json). ARGS="--dry-run" to preview,
## ARGS="--prepare" to package a pushed PR head during final checks, without publishing,
## ARGS="--minor" for a forced-update minor bump, ARGS="X.Y.Z" for an explicit version. The by-hand
## escape hatches (upload-desktop, upload-desktop-linux, upload-node-runtime, upload-tmux-runtime) live in desktop/Makefile.
release-desktop:
	bash desktop/scripts/release-desktop.sh $(ARGS)

## release-web: ship the browser app to harness.autonomous.ai — tag this commit vX.Y.Z_web; CI builds
## the Flutter bundle into website/'s image and pushes it (ArgoCD deploys). Re-run with the same version
## to resume waiting on a tag that already exists.
## ARGS="--dry-run" to preview, ARGS="--minor" or ARGS="X.Y.Z" to bump differently.
release-web:
	bash desktop/scripts/release-web.sh $(ARGS)

## install-cli: bundle the CLI from THIS working tree and install it into ~/.harness/cli — the local dev
## loop, nothing published. Restarts the daemon on the new bytes. Self-update stays ON: the build is
## labelled with the published version, which the release you are level with cannot outrank, so your bytes
## survive until a NEWER version ships — then it lands. ARGS="--no-updates" to pin instead.
install-cli:
	bash cli/scripts/install-cli.sh $(ARGS)

## upload-cli-install-sh: publish cli/scripts/install.sh — the `curl ... | bash` installer — to
## harness/cli/install.sh in the release bucket (-> https://cdn.autonomous.ai/harness/cli/install.sh).
## One static file, no version; MAINTAINER ONLY (an authenticated `gcloud storage` with write access
## on the bucket). The CLI bundle itself is never published from a laptop: `make release-cli` tags,
## and CI runs cli/scripts/upload-cli.sh from the tag (.github/workflows/release.yml). Verify the CDN edge
## serves the new bytes afterwards (the script prints the command).
upload-cli-install-sh:
	bash cli/scripts/upload-install-sh.sh

## remote-machine: drive a SECOND harness machine in Docker, so the app's remote path (relay ->
## another machine's daemon) can be tested from one laptop. ARGS picks the step:
##   make remote-machine ARGS=build   -> bundle this tree + build the image
##   make remote-machine ARGS=up      -> start the box
##   make remote-machine ARGS=login   -> SSO on the box (interactive)
##   make remote-machine ARGS=link    -> let this Mac's relay reach it
##   make remote-machine ARGS=verify  -> what each remote agent is ACTUALLY running on
##   make remote-machine ARGS=destroy -> throw it away (prints how to drop the machine record)
## See cli/docker/remote-machine/README.md.
remote-machine:
	bash cli/scripts/remote-machine.sh $(ARGS)

## upload-circle: bump version -> build -> publish the dial's firmware OTA. MAINTAINER ONLY.
##
## NOT a tag-triggered release like the three above, and deliberately so: this builds with a local
## ESP-IDF toolchain and writes straight to the GCS bucket every running dial polls, so it needs an
## authenticated `gcloud storage` and a sourced IDF env on the machine that runs it. There is no CI runner with
## a board attached to check the result. See devices/harness-device/firmware/RELEASE.md.
##
## ARGS="--dry-run" to preview, ARGS="X.Y.Z" for an explicit version, ARGS="--no-bump" to rebuild and
## upload what version.txt already says.
upload-circle:
	bash devices/harness-device/firmware/scripts/upload-firmware.sh $(ARGS)

## device-test: the firmware's host-side unit tests — frame codec, machine list, carousel ring.
##
## Plain `cc` on the host, no board and no ESP-IDF: the parts worth testing here are arithmetic and
## parsing, and a test that needed hardware attached is a test nobody runs.
device-test:
	bash devices/harness-device/firmware/test/run.sh
