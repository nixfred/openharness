# Terminal workspace design system

Harness should feel like a terminal workspace, from its tab bar to its welcome
page, dialogs, and contextual controls. **Text first. Keyboard first. Fixed
cells.** Use this document for new workspace surfaces and visual reviews.

The [terminal dialog rules](terminal-dialogs.md) specify row and column geometry,
selection, input, and preview behavior. The [workspace status bar rules](workspace-status-bar.md)
specify tabs, pane headers, focused context, and model selection. Those documents
are the detailed implementation references for this system.

## Text is the interface

Use meaningful names and familiar terminal punctuation. Menu actions such as
`New Harness` use plain text and the same row highlight as other choices.
Standalone actions can use brackets, such as `[ Customize Harness ]`, instead
of rounded buttons with pictograms. A checkbox is
`[x]` or `[ ]`. Harness search has no prefix; `#` selects projects and `>` selects
commands as editable text. `@`, `:`, and `*` scope machines, models, and Store
inside the same picker. The top bar keeps focused model, machine, and project links plus `+` for New
Tab. Leave global search in Cmd-P and the app menu. Keep descriptive tooltips
and accessible names.

There is no broadly understood ASCII pencil. Keep `[ Customize Harness ]` after
customization as well as before it. The same action should retain its name and
location; a saved background must not silently replace it with an unlabeled icon.
Over artwork, a flat backing may protect text contrast. Do not add a pill,
bordered button well, logo, emoji, or ornamental icon to workspace controls.
User content and embedded viewers retain their own visual language.

## Keyboard is the primary path

Every workspace action needs an existing command or a clear keyboard interaction.
Resolve shortcut hints from the live keymap. Cmd-N creates a harness, Cmd-O opens projects (`#`), Cmd-P searches harnesses, and Cmd-Shift-P opens
commands (`>`) in the shared picker. Cmd-I opens models with `:` already entered;
typing Shift is unnecessary. From a live harness pane, Enter uses a served or
downloaded model for that pane, starting installed weights when necessary; Tab
switches between the list and controls. In Cmd-N, Tab switches between fields
and their choices. Up/Down navigates the active pane and Enter activates.
Cmd-P's model scope uses the same behavior. Cmd-T opens a tab, Cmd-W closes a tab, and
Cmd-Shift-W closes the focused pane view. Cmd-Q quits the app. Enter activates,
Space toggles, and Escape backs out or dismisses.

Closing a pane removes its view immediately, without a minimize animation.

Keep mouse access useful without adding duplicate floating controls. Clickable
text shows a hand cursor and bold text on hover, press, and keyboard focus.
Preserve the underlying colors, including filled status segments. Reserve both
text weights during layout so emphasis never shifts neighboring controls.
Resting controls stay unboxed. Tooltips describe the
action, not merely the text. Omit a tooltip that repeats the visible name;
show the full name when truncated, or a different underlying name. A model
selector says `Switch model · Subscription or local models`; include its full
model name only when shortened or temporarily replaced by a switching label. Disabled controls must not advertise an available
action or receive keyboard activation. Preserve accessibility names and focus
restoration; terminal styling is not permission to replace real controls with
inaccessible painted text.

## Use a real character grid

Measure columns and rows through `terminalCellSizeOf(context)` for dialogs and
welcome content. Text, margins, choices, and scrolling follow those dimensions.
Dialog selection highlights exactly one text row. Keep fixed font metrics when space
gets tight; truncate long values or reduce the number of visible columns.

Persistent tab, status, and pane bars use `workspaceBarTextStyle()` and
`workspaceBarCellSizeOf(context)`: 13 pt SF Mono regular on macOS and the platform
monospace stack on Linux, independent of terminal zoom. Every bar control uses
same minimum click height: `workspaceBarControlHeight()` (28 pt). The active tab
fills the entire bar height with the workspace background color, joining the
content below; selection keeps regular text and adds no `*` marker. Hovering a
tab uses bold text like other bar controls. No rounded corners, ripple, or
separate model-label well. Dialogs and welcome
actions use `terminalContentStyle()` and follow the terminal font preference.

## Keep surfaces quiet

First launch uses the same New Tab page as every later visit: “Harness like a
boss.” followed by five clickable shortcuts: Start an agent, Manage all your
agents, Deploy a local model, Manage all your machines, and Build beyond code.
Resolve the shortcut hints from the live keymap; unbound actions remain clickable.
Keep this page independent of onboarding progress; no checklist or automatic dialog.

Use terminal foreground, background, muted text, and selection colors. Workspace
dialogs use the same thin frame as a focused pane. Avoid raised cards, shadows,
rounded action pills, and redundant headings. Tabs use concise text labels, with
selection conveyed by background rather than bold type.

Status layouts and terminal palettes are separate choices. **Plain** always uses
the terminal foreground, including PR status. Shell layouts use the terminal's
ANSI colors. The named Pastel Powerline, Catppuccin Powerline, Tokyo Night, and
Gruvbox Rainbow presets carry their own status-only colors, resolved in the
shared status formatter for both Flutter and AppKit. Color off makes any preset
monochrome. Branch symbols and separators are drawn vectors so users can keep
their normal monospace font. Do not invent runtime facts, Git dirtiness, exit
status, or progress to decorate a theme.

## Make context useful

Show the focused pane's model, machine, compact project name, branch, and PR in the
shared app bar. A dependent viewer uses its owner's context. Keep internal
worktree paths and machinery out of everyday labels.

Machine opens the shared picker scoped to that machine. Project opens its harnesses across
known checkouts and machines. With session Git context, Branch opens Work details:
current observed checkout, launch workspace, observed branches and PR history.
Older daemons keep exact-branch project search. Hide detached commit hashes from
the bar. Ambiguous or unavailable work is plain context text, without a branch
symbol. These are navigation actions; they do not check out a branch.
The PR label opens that PR. Each field gets its own accessible link, tooltip, and
the shared hover treatment, including in joined Agnoster segments.

## Review in context

Check keyboard-only operation, hover, focus, disabled state, narrow windows,
long names, missing Git data, a dependent viewer, light and dark palettes, and
terminal font changes. Opening or dismissing controls must not send input to an
agent or recreate its terminal. Use synthetic data for screenshots.

Start with `TerminalTextAction`, `WorkspaceBarControl`, `WorkspaceStatusLine`, and
the Cmd-N/Cmd-O reference implementations. Native macOS controls must match the
Flutter fallback in behavior and appearance.
