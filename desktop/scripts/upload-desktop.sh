# Release the desktop app: bump version -> build -> notarize -> zip -> upload to a PUBLIC GCS bucket.
# The running app polls the manifest (DesktopUpdater) and offers to restart when a newer build
# lands. See RELEASE.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh              # auto-bump (1.2.3 -> 1.2.4; 1.2.99 -> 1.3.1)
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh --force       # bump the MINOR version (1.2.3 -> 1.3.1), per the
#                                                 # usual semver convention
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh 1.3.0         # release an explicit version
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh --no-bump     # keep the current published version, build + upload
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh --no-build    # upload the existing build/ artifact as-is
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh --no-notarize # skip Apple notarization (Developer ID signed only)
#   GCS_BUCKET=other bash scripts/upload-desktop.sh   # env overrides (see below)
#
# The CURRENT version is read from the remote metadata.json on GCS (single source of truth) and the
# patch is bumped from there — nothing is git-committed, and `pubspec.yaml`'s `version:` field is
# never touched. The version is stamped into the built bundle's Info.plist via `flutter build`'s
# `--build-name`/`--build-number` flags, and this script asserts the artifact really carries it
# before publishing, so the running release always equals the published manifest version.
#
# Prereqs: `gcloud storage` authenticated with WRITE access on the bucket; the
# bucket/objects must be public-read;
# `flutter` on PATH; the Xcode project signs Release with a "Developer ID Application" identity
# (see macos/Runner.xcodeproj — CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY/DEVELOPMENT_TEAM) whose certificate + private key
# must be in this machine's LOGIN keychain (NOT the System keychain — that one prompts for an admin
# password on every codesign, which a non-interactive build can't answer). For notarization, a
# `notarytool` keychain profile must exist — one-time setup, run once yourself (never pass the
# password as a script argument or env var, it would land in shell history):
#   xcrun notarytool store-credentials "harness-notarize" \
#     --apple-id "you@example.com" --team-id "54DJVWMJCC" --password "xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
# (an app-specific password from appleid.apple.com, not your Apple ID password). Override the
# profile name with NOTARY_PROFILE if you used a different one, or skip notarizing with
# --no-notarize (the build stays Developer ID signed, just without Apple's online-verifiable ticket
# — Gatekeeper is more likely to warn on a copy downloaded fresh by someone else).
