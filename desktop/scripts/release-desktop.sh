# Cut a desktop release: work out the next version, tag it, push the tag. CI does everything else —
# ../.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml builds macOS + Linux, publishes to GCS, and creates the
# GitHub Release. The tag IS the version; CI never bumps on its own. Tags are "vX.Y.Z_desktop" — the
# "_desktop" suffix is stripped by release-desktop.yml before anything treats it as a version; it
# exists only so this tag never also triggers the CLI's "vX.Y.Z_cli" or the backend's "vX.Y.Z_backend"
# release, now that all three live in one repo.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, `make release-desktop ARGS=...` runs the same thing):
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh                    # bump the patch and release
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh --dry-run          # print everything, tag nothing, push nothing
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh --minor            # bump the MINOR version, per the usual semver
#                                                      # convention
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh 1.1.0              # release an explicit version
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh --notes-file f.md  # hand-written release notes instead of the
#                                                      # generated commit list
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh --wait             # finish when this tag is live and verified
#   bash scripts/release-desktop.sh --prepare          # package the pushed PR head during final checks; no publication
#
# THE NEXT VERSION COMES FROM TWO SOURCES, AND BOTH MATTER. Git tags alone are not enough: this repo
# had one tag (v1.0.52) while the live manifest was already serving 1.0.61, because
# scripts/upload-desktop.sh bumps from the manifest and tags nothing. Bumping from tags there would
# have produced 1.0.53 — a version LOWER than what users already run, which every app refuses to
# install (semverGt in lib/update/desktop_updater.dart) while the release still looks successful. So
# the current version is max(highest git tag, highest version in the manifest), across ALL of the
# manifest's desktop-* keys, not just the macOS one.
#
# Requires: git, curl, python3, push access to origin; gh for --wait. No GCS credentials — the manifest is read
# over public HTTPS, exactly as scripts/upload-desktop.sh reads it.
