# Release the Linux desktop app: bump version -> build -> package -> upload to a PUBLIC GCS bucket.
# Mirrors scripts/upload-desktop.sh (macOS) — see RELEASE.md for the shared design this follows.
# There is no Apple-equivalent signing/notarization step here: the running app self-updates from a
# checksum-verified manifest entry (DesktopUpdater), which is the trust boundary on both platforms.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh              # auto-bump (1.2.3 -> 1.2.4; 1.2.99 -> 1.3.1)
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh --force       # bump the MINOR version (1.2.3 -> 1.3.1) —
#                                                       # running apps treat this as a mandatory
#                                                       # update (see desktop_updater.dart)
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh 1.3.0         # release an explicit version (a major bump,
#                                                       # e.g. 2.0.0, is also forced)
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh --no-bump     # keep the current published version, build + upload
#   bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh --no-build    # upload the existing build/ artifact as-is
#   TARGET_ARCH=arm64 bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh
#   TARGET_ARCH=amd64 bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh  # amd64 is normalized to x64
#   GCS_BUCKET=other bash scripts/upload-desktop-linux.sh   # env overrides (see below)
#
# The CURRENT version is read from the remote metadata.json on GCS — the SAME manifest the macOS
# script publishes to, under an architecture-specific key (`desktop-linux-arm64` or
# `desktop-linux-x64`). Nothing is git-committed; pubspec.yaml's `version:` field is never touched
# (see RELEASE.md).
#
# `flutter build linux` has no Info.plist-style version stamping, so this script writes a plain
# version.txt into the built bundle instead — read back by lib/core/app_version.dart at runtime and
# by lib/update/desktop_updater.dart's downloadAndStage() when verifying a downloaded update.
#
# Prereqs: `gcloud storage` authenticated with WRITE access; the bucket/objects must be
# public-read; `flutter` on PATH; must run on an actual Linux (Ubuntu) build host — `flutter build
# linux` cannot cross-compile a Linux bundle from macOS or Windows. APPIMAGETOOL must point at an
# executable `appimagetool-<x86_64|aarch64>.AppImage` — see release.yml for how CI fetches one.
