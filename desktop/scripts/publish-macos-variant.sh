# Publish ONE of the two macOS builds: build -> pin its renderer -> hand the bundle to
# scripts/upload-desktop.sh --no-build, which packages, notarizes, uploads and merges the manifest
# through its flags and env overrides. --no-build accepts an existing APP_BUNDLE so
# build-macos-variants.py can compile once and derive both renderers. See RELEASE.md.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh intel 1.2.4                # desktop-macos       — Skia
#   bash scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh apple-silicon 1.2.4        # desktop-macos-arm64 — Impeller
#   bash scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh intel 1.2.4 --build-only   # build + pin, publish nothing
#   bash scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh intel 1.2.4 --no-notarize  # forwarded to upload-desktop.sh
#   bash scripts/publish-macos-variant.sh intel 1.2.4 --build-only --dart-define=HARNESS_GRID_SURFACE=true
#                                                                    # forwarded to flutter build only
#   (x64 / x86_64 are accepted for intel, arm64 / aarch64 for apple-silicon.)
#
# ONE universal app, two bundles. Flutter renders macOS with Impeller by default, and Intel users
# report the app stuttering while Apple Silicon renders it fine — the one thing that differs between
# them running the same universal build is the GPU Impeller drives. A release build can only opt out
# through Info.plist (`FLTEnableImpeller`; the engine compiles its switches out of release), and an
# Info.plist belongs to a bundle, so choosing by CPU means shipping two. Both stay universal
# (arm64 + x86_64): either one still launches on any Mac, which the Intel one has to (below).
#
# The Intel build keeps the OLD key and file name on purpose. `desktop-macos` is what every install
# from before this split polls, on either CPU, and `desktop-macos-dmg` is what the website download
# serves. Putting the Skia build there fixes every Intel Mac on its next update, with no new updater
# needed first, and hands a new visitor a build that works on whatever Mac they have. Apple Silicon
# moves onto its Impeller build one update later, once it runs an updater that asks for
# desktop-macos-arm64 (lib/update/desktop_updater.dart — the keys below must match it).
#
# The version is REQUIRED: two runs have to publish one version, and upload-desktop.sh's auto-bump
# reads the manifest, so the second run would see the first one's upload and bump again.
#
# OTA_KEY, DMG_KEY, GCS_PATH and DMG_GCS_PATH are set here per build and override the caller's, so the
# two runs can never write each other's keys or paths. Everything else upload-desktop.sh reads
# (GCS_BUCKET, METADATA_PATH, SIGN_IDENTITY, NOTARY_PROFILE, ...) passes straight through.
