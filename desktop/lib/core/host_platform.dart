/// `installFileLogs`, which is deliberately not `async` so that the first lines
/// about starting up are not lost to a directory probe. Not adding a plugin
/// matters too — registering one rewrites the macOS SPM package list for every
/// desktop build as well (see CLAUDE.md).

/// way it always has rather than quietly writing somewhere unexpected.
