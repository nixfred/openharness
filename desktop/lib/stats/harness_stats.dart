/// How much work this app has done: agents started, turns taken, time spent.
///
/// Ported from Orca's `src/main/stats/` — same three cards, same "tracking
/// since" line, same balanced start/stop accounting for the clock.
///
/// **What it counts and what it does not.** These are the app's OWN events, not
/// a vendor's and not a file on disk: the ledger beside it (`usage/ledger/`)
/// reads what the agent CLIs wrote and counts tokens, and this counts what
/// Harness itself watched happen. So it needs no permission and has no enable
/// switch — an app may count what it did.
///
/// ⚠️ **Two deliberate differences from Orca.**
///
/// 1. **PRs are not a Harness concept**, so the third card is TURNS. Orca opens
///    pull requests from its worktrees and counts them; this app launches agents
///    on machines and never touches a forge. A card wired to a number that can
///    only ever be zero is worse than a card showing something true, and turns
///    fall out of the same event stream the clock already needs.
/// 2. **No event log is kept.** Orca persists up to 10,000 individual events
///    beside its aggregates, for per-repo breakdowns it does not yet draw. That
///    costs a ~900KB rewrite every few seconds on a busy session, so what is
///    persisted here is the aggregates alone. [firstEventAt] is the reason Orca
///    needed the log to be lossy-safe, and it is stored directly here for the
///    same reason: it is set once and never moves, so trimming can never drag
///    "tracking since" forward.
