/// What a tile shows.
///
/// A [web] tile is a domain harness's viewer — the board, the part, the
/// episode — served on the agent's machine and drawn beside that agent's
/// terminal. It is DERIVED from the agent (the daemon says where the viewer
/// is, and the tile follows) and never persisted: a restored layout re-opens
/// it from the agent's next frame, so a stale URL from a previous run can
/// never be loaded. [companion] is the built-in native viewer, derived from
/// the selected individual only after its account's experiment is enabled.
enum PaneKind { terminal, web, companion }

/// One tile in the terminal grid.
///
/// The INTENT (which agent this tile is for) and the live [session] are kept
/// apart on purpose. A restored layout names agents on machines that have not
/// answered yet, and machines answer in an order this side does not decide —
/// so a tile has to be able to exist, and say what it is waiting for, before
/// there is anything to attach. The same split is what lets a tile survive its
/// machine going offline and coming back without the grid reshuffling around
/// it.
