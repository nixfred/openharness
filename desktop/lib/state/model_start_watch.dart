///   composer, and one sent from another client alike; the composer alone would miss the first.
///   A `turn_started` marked `replay` is a turn picked back up at attach, not a message now.
/// * **First output** is the first `text_delta` or `tool_start` of that turn — the model answering —
///   or the turn ending (`turn_ended`, a deleted agent, a lost connection).
///
/// Terminal output is deliberately NOT a signal: the first bytes a pane prints after Enter are the
/// engine echoing the prompt and drawing its own spinner, which would end the chip the moment it
/// appeared. Those events are what this app already trusts for the rail's working mark.
