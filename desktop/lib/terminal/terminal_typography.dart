/// The default terminal face, per platform.

/// Every family named here has to actually resolve on the OS it is named for,
/// and a *monospace* one: the renderer measures one cell by laying out ten `m`
/// glyphs and dividing by ten (`TerminalPainter._measureCharSize`), so a
/// proportional substitute misaligns every column a TUI draws.
///
/// Asking for a face the system does not have is not a loud failure. Measured
/// on Ubuntu 26.04 with a real Linux build (`TextPainter`, 13px, advance width
/// of `m` vs `i` — equal means monospace):
///
/// ```text
/// DejaVu Sans Mono                m=7.83  i=7.83   ← monospace
/// Ubuntu Sans Mono                m=7.28  i=7.28   ← monospace
/// Liberation Mono                 m=7.80  i=7.80   ← monospace
/// .AppleSystemUIFontMonospaced    m=11.22 i=3.16   ← PROPORTIONAL
/// Menlo                           m=11.22 i=3.16   ← PROPORTIONAL
/// monospace  (the generic)        m=11.22 i=3.16   ← PROPORTIONAL
/// NoSuchFamilyXYZ                 m=11.22 i=3.16   ← the engine's own default
/// ```
///
/// Two things follow. The old macOS-only stack rendered the terminal in a
/// proportional face on Linux, at 3.5× the width for `m` over `i` — that is the
/// broken grid. And **the trailing `'monospace'` is inert**: Flutter resolves
/// families through Skia, which does not honour fontconfig's generic aliases,
/// so it measures exactly like a family that does not exist. It stays in the
/// lists as a last resort for other engines, but it is not a safety net — every
/// chain has to name a real face it can reach. On Linux that anchor is DejaVu
/// Sans Mono, the only monospace `ubuntu-desktop-minimal` depends on.
///
/// The live, user-chosen typography lives in `terminalFontStore`, not here;
/// these are what a fresh install opens with and what `reset()` returns to.

/// SF Mono's CoreText family name.
///
/// Flutter does not reliably resolve the human-facing `SF Mono` name on macOS;
/// this is the system alias that CoreText resolves to Apple's monospaced face.
