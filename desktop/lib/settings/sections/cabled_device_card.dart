/// The robot on a cable at this desk, and everything it persists.
///
/// It lives in Settings ▸ Autonomous robots rather than in a section of its own because somebody
/// looking for their robot's settings looks under "Autonomous robots"; what sits below it is a
/// different thing wearing the same word — robots paired over the network, managed through the CLI.
///
/// **The pane says which robot it is changing, out loud and first.** That is not decoration. These
/// rows look exactly like the app's own preferences — same [SettingRow], same controls, same column —
/// and read as settings for *Harness* unless something says otherwise. So the first thing on the
/// pane is "These settings apply to" and a card naming the robot, what it is running and whether it
/// is here. With two on the desk that card is also the picker, because a setting belongs to one
/// robot: reading them as account-wide would silently overwrite one device with the other's taste
/// the first time somebody touched a row.
///
/// Two more rules it is built on:
///
/// * **The device owns the values.** Nothing is written here optimistically. A change is sent and the
///   pane moves when the device answers with what it now holds, so a refusal corrects the window
///   instead of leaving it showing its own hope.
/// * **Read-only while unplugged.** The rows stay — a person should be able to read what their robot
///   is set to with it in a drawer — but nothing can be changed, because there is nothing on the
///   other end to agree.
