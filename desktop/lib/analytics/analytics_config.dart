/// website and the Grid desktop app report into. Sharing the destination is the
/// point: someone who read the site, installed Grid and then installed Harness
/// is one funnel, not three datasets that can never be joined. [category] is
/// what keeps them apart within it.
///
/// ⚠️ **This app reports under GRID's write key, not one of its own.** The
/// constant below is the same one `autonomous-grid-app` ships, so both desktop
/// apps append into the same analytics project. That is a deliberate stopgap —
/// a muted stream measures nothing, and this app has been waiting on a key of
/// its own since the port — but the cost is real and worth stating: the two
/// apps are then separable **only by [category]** (`harness-desktop` against
/// Grid's `grid-app`, stamped on every event), not at the source. Anyone
/// reading the Grid project sees this app's events inside it, and anything set
/// per project — a quota, a retention rule, a rotated or revoked key — lands on
/// both apps at once.
