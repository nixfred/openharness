/// store is async, serialised behind a lock and holds credentials, while this

/// app state a user may reasonably want to open and edit by hand.
///
/// Lenient like the other app stores — a missing, corrupt or hand-edited file
/// reads as "no ids yet" rather than throwing, because the alternative is an
/// analytics detail breaking the launch it was meant to measure. Both files are
/// overridable so tests never touch a real Harness home.
