/// The paired daemon's face in the status line: its mood, its blinks, the
/// frames it steps through while agents work and the one line it says.
///
/// The rules are the README's (`daemons/README.md`, Moods, Motion and blinks,
/// Voice). Moods come from work. Illustrated idle motion has a separate visual clock.
///
/// - **Motion** is driven by work, not by time: while agents work, the work
///   frame steps once per real agent event ([pulse]), at most twice a second,
///   so a baton that stops means an agent that stopped. The only timers end a
///   held reaction, run decorative motion, end a nap and clear a line.
///   Reduce Motion, a background window and the Motion setting stop them all;
///   the face still changes.
/// - **Interruptions**: only a harness waiting on you and a failure take over
///   the status line, in the message yellow, at most one line nobody asked for
///   every two minutes, never about the pane in front of you, and only after
///   Enter, a pane switch or 8 s without a key. Finished turns become `3 done`
///   beside the daemon, cleared when you look. Replies (a boop, its first
///   words, why an answer failed, the pair answering you) are dim. Quiet
///   silences everything.
/// - **The pair brain's lines** (`daemon_say`) are shown exactly as sent,
///   keys first (`[y/n/g] api@office Bash: npm test`), for their `ttlMs`:
///   their keys work only while the line shows, and only once the window has
///   drawn it and its `detail` (the daemon's `daemon_shown` rule). A line the
///   pair harness wrote (`from: 'pair'`) is drawn as it speaking.
