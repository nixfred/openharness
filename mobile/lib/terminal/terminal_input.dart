/// Makes ⌥⏎ a newline inside the engine's prompt instead of a submit.
///
/// Claude Code, Codex and every other Ink/readline prompt read Meta+Enter — `ESC` followed by the
/// ordinary Return bytes — as "add a line, do not send this turn yet". A real terminal produces
/// that only when it is configured to treat ⌥ as Meta (iTerm's "Esc+", Terminal.app's "Use Option
/// as Meta Key"); xterm.dart has no such setting, and its [AltInputHandler] deliberately does
/// nothing on macOS so ⌥ stays the compose key for `å`/`ø`/`¬`. So ⌥⏎ fell through to the keytab,
/// which matches on `Return` alone and answers `\r` — the submit. The key the desktop's shortcuts
/// sheet promises (its `kTerminalOwnedKeys`) sent the turn instead of breaking the line.
///
/// ⌥ is Meta for THIS ONE KEY, not for the keyboard: Enter carries no character to compose, so
/// prefixing it costs nothing that ⌥-as-compose needs, and the rest of the alphabet is untouched.
///
/// The base bytes are asked of [_inner] rather than written out here, because Return is not always
/// `\r`: under LNM (`lineFeedMode`) the keytab answers `\r\n`, and a caller may pass a keytab of
/// its own. Alt and Shift are cleared for that question — Alt so the keytab does not see the very
/// modifier being translated, Shift so ⌥⇧⏎ yields a prefixed Return rather than a prefixed `\EOM`,
/// which no prompt would recognise.
