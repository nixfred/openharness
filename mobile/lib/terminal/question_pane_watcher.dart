/// still runs, still drives `blockedAgents`, and still answers from wherever a
/// person actually answers. This only tells the page it is attached to whether

/// cannot reach a phone on the relay — see [readQuestionPane].
///
/// ⚠️ **Debounced on both edges, and the two are not symmetric.** A redraw
/// arrives as a burst of writes and a capture taken mid-repaint parses as
/// no-dialog, so a question appearing waits for the buffer to settle
/// ([_settle]) while a question LEAVING must additionally miss [_goneReads]
/// consecutive reads. The daemon learned the same thing the same way — see
/// `GONE_TICKS` in askQuestion.ts: announcing a close on the first miss yanked
/// a live question off the screen.
///
/// ⚠️ **Whoever listens must treat a repeat as nothing new.** This notifies on
/// every CHANGE of dialog — and of Codex's queue of async questions ([queued])
/// — including one question replacing another inside the same exchange; a
/// listener that raises the keyboard on each notification would raise it again
