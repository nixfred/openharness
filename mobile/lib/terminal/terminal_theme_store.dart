/// window — sidebar, tabs, dialogs — and until this existed the terminal's
/// ground was simply borrowed from it, so the only way to sit an agent on a

/// remote program is drawing into". They are not the same question, and the
/// font settings beside this one already answer the second independently.

/// Deliberately a closed enum rather than free colour fields: sixteen ANSI
/// slots plus foreground, background, cursor and selection is a surface no
/// preferences pane can make legible, and a half-chosen ramp renders TUIs
/// unreadable in ways the user cannot attribute to what they changed. Adding a
/// scheme later is one value here and one `const` in `terminal_theme.dart`.
