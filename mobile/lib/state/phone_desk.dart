/// The account's desk — its tabs, the same on every computer — as a PHONE holds
/// it.
///
/// `desk_sync.dart` (vendored from the desktop, unchanged) has the document's
/// shape and the backend's own rules replayed for optimistic writes. This is
/// the phone's half of it, and it is deliberately not the desktop's half:
///
/// ⚠️ **The phone FOLLOWS the desk; it does not project itself onto it.** A
/// window's tabs are its `swarms`, so the desktop diffs that projection after
/// every layout change and sends the difference. The phone's `swarms` are not
/// tabs at all — they are the one-pane container a pager attaches into, and it
/// attaches the agents either side of the one on screen ahead of a swipe. A
/// projection of THAT would add every agent a thumb passes to whatever tab the
/// phone happened to be in, on every computer the person owns. So nothing here
/// is derived from `swarms`: the tabs are read, and every write is one a person
/// made by hand on the phone — [adopt] for an agent created here, [drop] for one
/// deleted here, and [createTabFor]/[addToTab] for the two `+`s on the tabs
/// panel.

/// What is NOT on the desk stays per device, as it does on a window: which tab
/// is open ([activeTabId]) is this phone's own, and so is the agent within it.
