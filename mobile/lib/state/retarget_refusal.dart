/// What the app says when the daemon refuses to move an agent to another model.
///
/// One sentence per refusal, in the app's own words. The daemon's `detail` is not shown: it is
/// written for its log and names the grid, and the user's vocabulary is "Subscription" and "Local".
/// Every code the daemon's `agent_retarget` can answer with is here, and an unknown one still gets a
/// sentence rather than the code — a new refusal in a newer daemon must not surface as `SOME_CODE`.
///
/// These refusals happen BEFORE the pane is touched (an engine with no way onto a Local model, a
/// busy agent, a machine that cannot resolve its Local models), so nothing in the terminal ever
/// says why. Until this existed, picking a Local model for a Cursor agent simply did nothing.
