/// that blanked whenever a network hiccup landed would be worse than one that
/// quietly went [stale].
///
/// ⚠️ **Deliberately different from the desktop's controller in ONE way: this
/// one reads no LOCAL sources.** The desktop constructs its
/// `[ClaudeUsageSource(), CodexUsageSource()]` by default (neither has a copy
/// here), because the machine
/// it runs on is also the machine `claude login` and `codex login` wrote their
/// tokens on — the macOS Keychain item `Claude Code-credentials`,
/// `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.codex/auth.json`. **A phone has none of
/// those**, and never will: no agent CLI ever signs in here, and the sandbox
/// has no `~` in the sense those paths mean. The desktop's `UsageCredentials` would answer
/// null for every one of them — safely, since it only ever `existsSync`s a file
/// and skips the Keychain off macOS — but the readings it produced would all be
/// [UsageStatus.signedOut], which is the exact wrong sentence: it invites the
/// reader to sign in on a device where signing in is not a thing that exists,
/// and the empty state it drives would hide the real answer, that no machine
/// has been linked yet.
///
/// So on the phone the sources list is EMPTY and every figure comes from
/// `usage_read` over the relay — see [remote] and `AppNotifier.readRemoteUsage`.
/// The seam is kept rather than removed: the parameter still takes sources, so
/// the grouping, the statuses and this file's shape stay identical to the
/// desktop's, and a build that one day has a local account to read needs no new
/// controller.
