///
/// The phone's launch is a long chain of awaits — preferences off disk, the SSO
/// session, `/api/machines`, a relay dial per machine, the E2EE handshake on top
/// of it, and only then the agent list. Every one of those is a plausible
/// suspect for a slow start, and until each is timed separately the only honest
/// answer to "why is it slow" is a guess. The screen says
/// "Connecting to your machine…" for all of them at once (see
/// `phone/phone_status.dart`), so the UI cannot be read as a progress bar
/// either.
///
/// Two shapes, because the launch has two:
///  - [mark] for a moment on one timeline — how far into the launch it happened.
///  - [time]/[timeSync] for a span, which is what a suspect actually needs: the
///    span's own cost, not its position.
///
/// ⚠️ **Both write through [appLog], which is a SYNCHRONOUS, FLUSHED file write
/// on the UI isolate** (see `logging/log_file.dart`). That is fine for the tens
/// of events a launch produces and is emphatically not fine per frame or per
/// terminal chunk: instrument phases here, never hot paths.
///
/// Timings are always on, in release too. A launch that is slow on a tester's
/// phone and fast on a developer's is exactly the launch worth measuring, and
/// `~/.harness/logs/app-YYYYMMDD.log` is where that evidence already lives —
/// the same reasoning that keeps the file sink itself unconditional
/// (`logging/debug_surface.dart`).
