/// The top of a phone page, drawn below the status bar and the Dynamic Island rather than into
/// them — the desktop chrome only ever had traffic lights to clear.
///
/// [large] is the first page's big title, the iOS way. Every other page gets a back chevron and
/// a compact title that can carry a [leading] mark and a quieter [subtitle] line.
///
/// On a page that can pop, the whole left band — chevron, [leading] mark, title and [subtitle] —
/// is the back target, not just the 24px chevron box. A 30px glyph at the very edge of the screen
/// is the hardest thing on the page to hit one-handed, and everything beside it names the page you
/// are leaving rather than doing anything of its own. [trailing] stays outside the band: those are
/// real controls, and swallowing their taps would be the worse bug.
