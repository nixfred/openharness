/// Where an agent IS: the folder it was started in, the branch that folder is on, and the machine
/// running it — `autonomous-harness · ⑂ main · MacBookPro2021.local`.
///
/// The same three facts, in the same order, as the desktop's pane header, so an agent recognised
/// on one screen is recognised on the other. A name alone stops identifying anything the moment somebody has two `main` agents, which
/// on a phone — where the Agents tab mixes every machine into one list — happens immediately.
///
/// ⚠️ **Two flexible halves, not one line of text.** A phone row leaves this about 240pt, and the
/// three together want more than that: `autonomous-harness · ⑂ feat/mobile-ios-android` alone fills
/// it. Written as a single ellipsised line, the machine — the last of the three, and the reason the
/// line exists on a list that mixes machines — is the part that disappears entirely. Split in two,
/// each half truncates within its own share instead, so the machine is always at least begun.
///
/// Which leaves the branch as the one that gives way, and deliberately: it shares the left half
/// with the folder and is cut first when that half runs out. It is the least use in *finding* an
/// agent, and the terminal page names it in full once one is open.
