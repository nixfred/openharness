/// What the New Harness form was left holding, so opening it again comes back to it.
///
/// The desktop's `NewHarnessDraft` (`desktop/lib/state/new_harness.dart`), and kept the way the
/// desktop keeps it: **in memory, for as long as the app runs**. Nothing here is written to disk.
/// Closing the form is not the same as changing your mind about it — somebody who backed out to
/// check which branch they meant should not have to name the folder, the engine and the approvals
/// again — but a choice made yesterday is not an answer to a question asked today.
///
/// ⚠️ **Dropped once a harness is actually created, not kept.** The desktop closes its box with
/// `keepDraft: false` on `onCreated` for the same reason: the draft exists to survive a
/// cancellation, and a form that reopens pre-filled with the harness you just started is a second
/// one waiting to be made by accident.
///
/// The engine alone outlives this, and always did — `AppNotifier.agentPreference` remembers it
/// across launches, so a phone that has never opened this form still starts on the right one.
