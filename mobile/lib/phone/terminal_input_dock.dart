/// The bottom of a terminal page while the keyboard is up: [TerminalKeyBar] over
/// it, following the session's input state. Nothing while it is down — the foot
/// row with the mic is the page's then.
///
/// ⚠️ **The row OPENS and CLOSES, rather than appearing and vanishing whole.**
/// The pane above it is an `Expanded`, so every pixel this row takes is a pixel
/// the terminal loses — and it used to take all of them in a single frame, on
/// the tap, while the keyboard underneath it was only beginning to rise. The
/// terminal's bottom edge therefore jumped ~47px and then slid the rest of the
/// way over the ~250ms the keyboard spends travelling: one move of one edge,
/// arriving as a jump followed by a slide. That is the judder.
///
/// Opened over [slide] instead, the two move together and the edge travels once.
///
/// ⚠️ **Timed, not driven by the keyboard's inset.** Following the inset sounds
/// stricter and cannot be done: what the row needs is the FRACTION of the rise
/// that is over, and the platform announces no keyboard height to measure that
/// against — the first frame of a rise reports an inset that means "barely
/// started" on one phone and "nearly up" on another, and taking it for a
/// fraction snaps the row open exactly as before. [slide] is matched to the
/// platform's own keyboard curve, which is the same on every phone that has one.
