  // the thing it was steering towards was a page it had to PUSH over an agents list. There is no
  // list and no push: [AgentHome] is the stack's root, and it reads the last-agent record, waits
  // for the machines to answer and picks the agent, all as part of drawing itself.
  //
  // One move is left, because no page can make it alone: a password accepted on a page pushed over
  // the home screen takes the person back to it, where the machine they just opened is about to
