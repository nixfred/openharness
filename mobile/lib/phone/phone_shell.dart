  // fall back to Machines when nothing answered, and time the wait out after 45 seconds, because
  // the thing it was steering towards was a page it had to PUSH over an agents list. There is no
  // list and no push: [AgentHome] is the Agents tab's root, and it reads the last-agent record,
  // waits for the machines to answer and picks the agent, all as part of drawing itself.
  //
  // One move is left, because it crosses tabs and no page can make it alone: a password accepted on
  // the Machines tab takes the person back to Agents, where the machine they just opened is about
  // to bring its agents with it.
