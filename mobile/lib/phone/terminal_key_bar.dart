/// The keys a phone keyboard does not have, in a strip above the one it does.
///
/// A pane is driven by `esc` and the arrows far more than by anything the
/// alphabet offers — interrupting Claude Code, walking shell history, moving
/// through a menu. None of them exist on a software keyboard, so
/// until this strip a phone could type at an agent but could not DRIVE one.
///
/// It appears with the keyboard and goes away with it: the terminal is short
/// enough on a phone that chrome is worth its height only while someone is
/// actually typing.
///
/// ⚠️ **ONE row, fixed, and nothing scrolls.** It used to be two — `↵`, `⇧tab`,
/// `ctrl` and a row of digits beside what is here now — and the second row cost
/// the terminal a line of output for keys the system keyboard below already
/// types (the digits) or that were rarely reached for. What is left is what a
/// phone keyboard cannot produce, or buries, and a pane is driven by:
///
/// ```
/// esc tab clear ← ↑ ↓ → /  │  🖼 ⌄
/// ```
///
/// Every key stays in the same place every time; this strip is used while
/// looking at the TERMINAL, not at the strip.
///
/// ⚠️ **One exception: `/` becomes `⏎` while an agent is asking something.**
/// A question dialog is driven by the arrows and Enter, and Enter is the one
/// the strip did not have — the keyboard's own `return` sends it, but nothing
/// on screen says so, and on a dialog that reads "enter to submit answer" a
/// strip of every other key it names reads as "Enter is missing". `/` is the
/// slot to give up: a dialog has no prompt to start a command in.
///
/// ⚠️ **The other exception: the pane's own keys — [hints] — join the row, and
/// only then does it scroll.** They are what Codex offers on this screen and
/// nowhere else (`ctrl+] skip`, `⌥+↓ main prompt`), so they follow the arrows
/// on the SAME row, which scrolls sideways while they are there and brings
/// them into view as they arrive. Never a line of their own: a second row
/// cost the terminal a line of output, and a strip of buttons floating over
/// the pane covered the very hints it was read off. The fixed keys keep their
/// size either way — only how far along the row is scrolled changes.
