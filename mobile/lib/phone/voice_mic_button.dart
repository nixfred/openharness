/// The one voice control on a terminal page — a small round button floating
/// over the terminal's bottom right corner. [VoiceMicFab] is what places it.
///
/// Two ways to work it, chosen by [voiceMicMode] and nothing else:
///
///  - [VoiceMicMode.tapToToggle] — tap to start, tap again to finish the
///    sentence and send it. The face says which tap is next: a mic, then an
///    arrow. Long-press is the language shortcut.
///  - [VoiceMicMode.holdToTalk] — the recording lasts exactly as long as the
///    thumb is down, and letting go sends. Sliding off the button first throws
///    the take away, and the face turns to a `×` to say so. No long-press:
///    that gesture is what records.
///
/// ⚠️ **It draws nothing past its circle.** What it is doing beyond its face —
/// the halo, and the words when something went wrong — is drawn around it
/// (`voice_bar_line.dart`), so the button's own box never grows and nothing
