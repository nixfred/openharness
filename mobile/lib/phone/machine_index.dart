/// Every machine the Machines tab draws, in the order a finger meets them.

/// The tab draws two sections — the ones that work, then the ones wanting something — and that
/// concatenation, not account order, is what somebody actually sees. The machine page swipes along
/// it, so it has to be built in ONE place: a pager computing "the next machine" from a slightly
/// different order than the list it was opened from would skip a machine, or hand back the one just
/// left, and nothing on screen would explain why. The same rule the Agents tab follows with
/// `visibleAgents`.
///
/// Unlike the agent list this one keeps EVERY machine, including the ones that need a password or
/// are offline. A machine row that cannot be opened is still worth a page: the password form is
/// exactly what somebody swiping past it came for, and an offline machine says so in words rather
/// than by being missing.
