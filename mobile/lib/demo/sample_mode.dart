/// Sample mode: the phone app, whole, over mock computers and harnesses — no account, no
/// network, nothing written anywhere the real app reads.
///
/// It is how someone tries Harness before they have a machine to link, and how we walk the app
/// as a first-time user: two computers, five harnesses in every state a harness can be in — one
/// working, one finished, one asking a question, two idle — each answering what it is told in a
/// few scripted lines, and New making more.

/// ```dart
/// TextButton(
///   onPressed: () => openSampleMode(context),

/// )
/// ```
///
/// What keeps it apart from the real app:
///
///  - its own [AppNotifier] ([SampleNotifier]), whose machines are in-process
///    ([SampleConnection]) and whose REST client answers everything itself ([SampleApiClient]);
///  - no `paneLayoutStore`, so every store the notifier keeps — last agent, project history,
///    search history, machine cache — remembers for this visit only, and its notices stay out of
///    the notification centre;
///  - its session, device keys and counters in memory ([SampleMemoryStore]);
///  - a microphone that records nothing ([SampleVoiceRecorder]);
///  - the New form's draft, which is a global, put back as it was when the sample is left.
