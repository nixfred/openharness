/// The app's one "still alive" rhythm.
///
/// `t` runs 0 → 1 → 0 forever on an ease-in-out curve; [builder] turns it
/// into whatever the caller is breathing — a skeleton's fill, a dot's alpha.
/// This widget owns the *timing* and nothing about the *shape*, which is what
/// lets every long-running thing in the app beat at the same tempo instead of
/// each pane hand-rolling its own `AnimationController`. That animation had
/// been written three separate times (the status LED, the login mark, the
/// model pill) and only two honoured Reduce Motion — the same heartbeat at
/// three tempos, one of them still moving for someone who had asked it to
/// stop.
///
/// Two decisions live here so no call site has to remember them:
///
/// - **Reduce Motion stops the beat at the peak (`t = 1`), not the middle.**
///   A block frozen at 40% opacity reads as *disabled*, which is the opposite
///   of what a placeholder means.
/// - **The [RepaintBoundary] is inside.** Everything built on this is
///   long-running by definition, and the shell keeps rail, bar and pane in one
///   layer — without the boundary a breathing skeleton in the sidebar repaints
///   the terminal beside it sixty times a second.
