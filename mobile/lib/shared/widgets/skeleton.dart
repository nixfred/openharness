/// Placeholders for content whose *shape* is already known.
///
/// A skeleton beats a spinner when you know what is coming: the layout does
/// not jump when the data lands, and what the reader waits on reads as "your
/// rows are on their way" rather than "something is happening somewhere". The
/// converse holds too — shape unknown, use a spinner; do not invent one.
///
/// Four rules every skeleton in the app keeps, in order of how often they are
/// broken elsewhere:
///
/// 1. **The rhythm is an opacity breath, not a shimmer sweep.** [Pulse] owns
///    it; a light band wiping across a pane fights the app's quiet.
/// 2. **A placeholder wears the real content's metrics.** One pixel off and it
///    causes the very jump it exists to prevent — which is why [SkeletonText]
///    measures the line box of the style it stands in for instead of guessing.
/// 3. **A block fades towards its bottom** ([skeletonFade]), so it reads as
///    "more below" rather than a wall cut off mid-list.
/// 4. **Line widths differ.** Equal bars turn a cluster into one grey slab.
///
/// The fill is [AppSurface.recess] breathing up to [AppSurface.recessHover]:
/// a translucent *well*, not a solid. A skeleton sits on top of a card, so it
/// borrows the token for a hollow rather than the card's own fill — it has to
/// read as an absence — and an overlay rides any ground (page, card, dialog)
/// without being re-measured against it.
